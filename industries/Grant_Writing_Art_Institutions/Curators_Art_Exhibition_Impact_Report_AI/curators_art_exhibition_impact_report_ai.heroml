You're tasked with writing an Exhibition Impact Report for the Grant Writing - Art Institutions industry, specifically for a Curator.
Remember, we're going to build this report in steps which allows us to focus and generate rich details for each section of the report. 
Let's embark on this task:

Step 1: Generate an introduction for the Exhibition Impact Report. This should entail the name of the exhibition: {{exhibition_name}}, the time it was conducted, and a brief summary of its theme or purpose.

Here's some more context about the Exhibition Impact Report:
Exhibition Name: {{exhibition_name}}
Curatorial Perspective: {{curatorial_perspective}}
Artworks Info: {{artworks_info}}
Visitor Statistics: {{visitor_statistics}}
Financial Summary: {{financial_summary}}
Exhibition Outcomes: {{exhibition_outcomes}}
Exhibition Review And Future Plans: {{exhibition_review_and_future_plans}}

Now, we have an introductory description of our Exhibition:

Step 2: Elaborate on the curatorial perspective. Explain in detail the curatorship directives and intentions for the exhibition: {{curatorial_perspective}}.

For our Exhibition Impact Report, we have an introduction and a detail into the curatorship:
