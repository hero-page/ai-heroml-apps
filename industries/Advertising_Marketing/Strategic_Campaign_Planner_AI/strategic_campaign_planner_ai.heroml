To create a "Campaign Strategy" for the "Advertising & Marketing" industry for a "Marketing Manager", let's start with the first step: 

1. Generate an executive summary that encapsulates the entire campaign. The summary should include the campaign's key objectives and goals, and it should be written in a concise manner.
