Your task is to write a "Code Documentation" for the "Blockchain & Cryptocurrency" industry, specifically for a "Blockchain Developer". 

Start with an introduction that describes the purpose and the overall functionality of your blockchain project: {{blockchain_functionality}}.

Here's some more context about the Code Documentation:
Blockchain Functionality: {{blockchain_functionality}}
Blockchain Architecture: {{blockchain_architecture}}
Smart Contracts: {{smart_contracts}}
Consensus Mechanism: {{consensus_mechanism}}
Transaction Processing: {{transaction_processing}}
Blockchain Security: {{blockchain_security}}
Technical Appendices: {{technical_appendices}}
Release Notes: {{release_notes}}

->>>>

Our "Code Documentation" begins with an introduction on our blockchain project:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Now, outline the architecture of the blockchain solution and discuss how various components interact with each other: {{blockchain_architecture}}.

->>>>

In our "Code Documentation", we've discussed the project's introduction and its architectural details:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Next, detail the smart contracts used in the project. For each contract, provide its purpose, functions, and interactions with other contracts: {{smart_contracts}}.

->>>>

So far in our documentation, we have detailed the introduction, the architecture, and the smart contracts of our blockchain project:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Smart Contracts:
{{step_3}}

Now, describe the consensus mechanisms in place, algorithms used, and reasons why they were chosen for your specific project: {{consensus_mechanism}}.

->>>>

We've discussed the introduction, architecture, smart contracts, and the consensus mechanism of the project in our "Code Documentation":

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Smart Contracts:
{{step_3}}

Consensus Mechanism:
{{step_4}}

Next, break down the process of how transactions are processed and recorded on the blockchain: {{transaction_processing}}.

->>>>

In our "Code Documentation", we've included explanations for the introduction, architecture, smart contracts, consensus mechanism, and transaction processing:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Smart Contracts:
{{step_3}}

Consensus Mechanism:
{{step_4}}

Transaction Processing:
{{step_5}}

After this, shed some light on the security measures and systems in place designed to protect the integrity of the blockchain: {{blockchain_security}}.

->>>>

In our "Code Documentation", we've discussed the introduction, architecture, smart contracts, consensus mechanism, transaction processing, and security measures of the project:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Smart Contracts:
{{step_3}}

Consensus Mechanism:
{{step_4}}

Transaction Processing:
{{step_5}}

Security Measures:
{{step_6}}

Next, include appendices that cover more complex or technical elements of code such as data structures and cryptographic functions: {{technical_appendices}}.
