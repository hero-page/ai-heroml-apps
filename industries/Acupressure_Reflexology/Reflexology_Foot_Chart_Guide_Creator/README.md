## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./reflexology_foot_chart_guide_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./reflexology_foot_chart_guide_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./reflexology_foot_chart_guide_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./reflexology_foot_chart_guide_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./reflexology_foot_chart_guide_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Reflexology Foot Chart Guide Creator

Your task is to write a "Foot Chart Explanation" for the "Acupressure & Reflexology" industry, specifically for a "Reflexologist". Let's start with an introductory context about the foot chart and reflexology referencing {{reference_context}}. 

Here's some more context about the Foot Chart Explanation:
Reference Context: {{reference_context}}
Foot Chart Structure: {{foot_chart_structure}}
Foot Zones: {{foot_zones}}
Zone Correspondence: {{zone_correspondence}}
Reflex Points: {{reflex_points}}
Pressure Application Methods: {{pressure_application_methods}}
Health Complaints And Relief Points: {{health_complaints_and_relief_points}}
Foot Chart Importance And Benefits: {{foot_chart_importance_and_benefits}}
Further Resources: {{further_resources}}

->>>>

Building on our foot chart explanation, we have set the context:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, document the general layout of the foot chart by providing details about its structure.

->>>>

We have introduced the context and outlined the structure of the foot chart:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Foot Chart Structure:
{{step_2}}

Proceed by dividing the foot chart into different zones. When referencing these zones in the explanation, use general names like "Zone 1", "Zone 2" and so on.

->>>>

We have depicted the structure of the foot chart and the division into zones:

Foot Chart Structure:
{{step_2}}

Foot Chart Zones:
{{step_3}}

Moving forward, detail how each zone on the foot chart corresponds to different parts or organs of the body.

->>>>

We have zones in the foot chart, now we have their correlation with body parts or organs:

Foot Chart Zones:
{{step_3}}

Corresponding Body Parts:
{{step_4}}

Next, describe the reflex points within each zone. To maintain clarity, when mentioning the points, designate them as "Point A", "Point B", and so forth.

->>>>

So far, we have laid out the zones along with their body correspondences and the reflex points in each zone:

Corresponding Body Parts:
{{step_4}}

Reflex Points:
{{step_5}}

Now, discuss how applying pressure to the specific reflex points can alleviate symptoms or promote healing.

->>>>

Until this point, we have described the reflex points and how applying pressure works:

Reflex Points:
{{step_5}}

Pressure Application:
{{step_6}}

Outline common health complaints and specify which reflex point or points should be pressed for relief.

->>>>

For the Foot Chart Explanation, we have pressure application methods and health complaints along with suggested points for relief:

Pressure Application:
{{step_6}}

Health Complaints and Relief Points:
{{step_7}}

Then summarize by re-emphasizing the significance of the foot chart and the potential benefits of correctly applying pressure to reflex points.
