Your task is to write a "Repair Estimate" for the "Automotive Sales & Services" industry, specifically for an "Automotive Technician". Let's start with an introduction by greeting the vehicle owner and providing details about the vehicle (e.g., year, make, model, mileage) {{vehicle_info}}. Also detail the reason for the estimate: {{estimate_reason}}.

Here's some more context about the Repair Estimate:
Estimate Reason: {{estimate_reason}}
Vehicle Info: {{vehicle_info}}
Initial Condition: {{initial_condition}}
Inspection Findings: {{inspection_findings}}
Proposed Services: {{proposed_services}}
Service Costs: {{service_costs}}
Service Duration: {{service_duration}}

We have an introduction for our repair estimate:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, we need to detail our inspection findings. Start by describing the initial condition of the vehicle upon drop-off, noting any visible issues: {{initial_condition}}. Then, present the results from your vehicle inspection, describing the discovered problems and what might have caused them: {{inspection_findings}}.

Estimate Costs:
{{step_4}}

Now, estimate how long each repair or maintenance process will take: {{service_duration}}. Also provide details about when the vehicle will be ready for pickup.

After giving a detailed cost estimation in:

Estimate Costs:
{{step_4}}

We have now provided an estimated duration for each service and the expected vehicle pick-up time:

Timeline and Logistics:
{{step_5}}

Let's conclude our repair estimate by giving the contact information of the technician or service department, so that the vehicle owner can follow-up their questions or concerns.
