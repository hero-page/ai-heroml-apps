Your task is to create a "Community Impact Report" for the "Grant Writing - Education Institutions" industry for a "School Administrator". 

Let's start by writing an executive summary that provides a synopsis of the overall impact of the school's activities within the community: {{summary_of_impact}}.

Here's some more context about the Community Impact Report:
Summary Of Impact: {{summary_of_impact}}
Mission And Goals: {{mission_and_goals}}
School Initiatives: {{school_initiatives}}
Outcomes And Significance: {{outcomes_and_significance}}
Ongoing Projects: {{ongoing_projects}}
Stakeholder Impact: {{stakeholder_impact}}
Future Actions: {{future_actions}}
