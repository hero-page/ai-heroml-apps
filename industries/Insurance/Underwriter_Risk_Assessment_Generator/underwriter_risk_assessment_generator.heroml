Our Risk Assessment Report now looks like:

Risk Identification and Evaluation:
{{step_4}}

Risk Ranking and Prioritization:
{{step_5}}

The following step requests us to detail risk mitigation strategies.
We need to discuss strategies to mitigate each identified and prioritized risk: {{mitigation_strategies}}. Include a cost-benefit analysis for each strategy.

Now, we should include an industry-specific consideration section. 
Here, we are going to provide an understanding of how industry-specific factors such as regulations, competition, market trends, and technology will impact the identified and prioritized risks: {{industry_specific_factors}}.

->>>>

Thus far, the Risk Assessment Report includes:

Risk Mitigation Strategies:
{{step_6}}

Industry-Specific Considerations:
{{step_7}}

The next step asks us to write a conclusion for the report.
