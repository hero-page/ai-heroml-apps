## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./ai_research_paper_generator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./ai_research_paper_generator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./ai_research_paper_generator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./ai_research_paper_generator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./ai_research_paper_generator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for AI Research Paper Generator
```
Your task is to write a "Research Paper" for the "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning" industry, specifically for an "AI Researcher". Let's start with writing an abstract that briefly summarizes your research in AI and machine learning.

Here's some more context about the Research Paper:
Research Summary: {{research_summary}}
Existing Landscape: {{existing_landscape}}
Previous Works: {{previous_works}}
Methodology: {{methodology}}
Results Findings: {{results_findings}}
Discussion Interpretation: {{discussion_interpretation}}
Improvements: {{improvements}}
Citations: {{citations}}
Appendices: {{appendices}}

->>>>

For this "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning" research paper, we have an abstract:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

The next step is to write an introduction that provides an overview of the existing landscape of AI and machine learning research. The introduction should also outline your research question or problem statement that the paper addresses.

->>>>

Now, we have an abstract and an introduction for our research paper:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Next, we'll create a literature review section that discusses previous works relating to your area of research or methodology in AI and machine learning. Highlight any gaps or areas that need further studies in this section.

->>>>

For the research paper, we have an abstract, introduction, and a literature review:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

Next, let's work on the methodology section. Provide a detailed explanation of the AI or machine learning algorithm, technique, or model you used to solve the problem or question.

->>>>

In our research paper, we have now completed the literature review and methodology sections:

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Now, it's time to establish a results or findings section. Present your findings responding to your research question, and explain how the AI or machine learning technique helped in giving these results. Try to use technical yet understandable language.

->>>>

In the research paper, we now have the methodology and results sections:

Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Results:
{{step_5}}

Next, we need to write a discussion and interpretation section. Here, you'll compare your findings with the previous literature. Conclude with the significance and implications of your findings on the AI and machine learning field.

->>>>

In the research paper, we've finished the results and discussion sections:

Results:
{{step_5}}

Discussion:
{{step_6}}

After that, we need a section that discusses possible future research or improvements on the developed AI or machine learning strategy. This section should be based on the limitations of your current research.

->>>>

In the research paper, we now have the discussion and future research sections:

Discussion:
{{step_6}}

Future Research:
{{step_7}}

Now, let's conclude the research paper by summarizing the purpose, methodology, and findings of the study.

->>>>

We now have the summary and future research sections for the research paper:

Summary:
{{step_8}}

Future Research:
{{step_7}}

Let's move on to citing all the literature and sources mentioned throughout your research paper. Make sure the citation style follows the standard in AI research.

->>>>

In our research paper, we have the summary, future research, and citations sections:

Summary:
{{step_8}}

Future Research:
{{step_7}}

Citations:
{{step_9}}

Finally, consider adding appendices to further enhance the reproducibility of your work. These could contain code snippets, algorithm descriptions, or additional result data not included in the main body of the paper.
