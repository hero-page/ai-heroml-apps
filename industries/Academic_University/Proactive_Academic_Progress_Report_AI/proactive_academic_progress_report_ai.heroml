Your task is to write an "Academic Progress Report" for the "Academic & University" industry, specifically for an "Academic Advisor". 

Let's begin by creating an overview that provides context for the specific academic period: {{academic_period}} the report covers.

Here's some more context about the Academic Progress Report:
Academic Period: {{academic_period}}
Student Name: {{student_name}}
Student Major: {{student_major}}
Academic Standing: {{academic_standing}}

We are creating an "Academic Progress Report", and we have a context for the academic period:

The "Academic Progress Report" with its discussion of academic performance is as follows:

We now need to add a section on Performance Trends where you provide an analysis of the student's progress over multiple periods, not just the current academic period. Compare the current performance with past performance, noting any trends, improvements, or areas of concern.

Let's now create a Future Planning section where you provide constructive feedback and suggest future course enrollments, academic resources, or any skill development programs that would help to improve the student's success rate. This recommendation part should correlate with the student's educational goals and their major.
