## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./agritech_product_roadmap_planner_ai.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./agritech_product_roadmap_planner_ai.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./agritech_product_roadmap_planner_ai.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./agritech_product_roadmap_planner_ai.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./agritech_product_roadmap_planner_ai.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Agritech Product Roadmap Planner AI
```
Your task is to write a "Product Roadmap" for the "Agricultural Technology" industry, specifically for a "Product Manager". 
Let's start by generating an executive overview detailing the objective of the roadmap and introducing the product you're referring to: {{product}}.

Here's some more context about the Product Roadmap:
Product: {{product}}
Target Market: {{target_market}}
Product Features: {{product_features}}
Development Milestones: {{development_milestones}}
Risks And Dependencies: {{risks_and_dependencies}}

->>>>

Now we have an overview of our product, fit for an executive summary:

Executive Overview:
{{step_1}}

Next, define and describe the target market of this product, including the needs and problems that the product is designed to address.

->>>>

So far, we have an executive overview and a description of our product's target market:

Executive Overview:
{{step_1}}

Target Market Description:
{{step_2}}

Now, let's provide an outline of the product's features and capabilities. Be sure to include each feature's or capability's value proposition and how it addresses the needs or problems of the target market.

->>>>

We have our product's executive overview, market specificity and now, a detailed feature list:

Executive Overview:
{{step_1}}

Target Market Description:
{{step_2}}

Product Features:
{{step_3}}

Next, identify some key development milestones for the product, such as major enhancements, integrations, or launches. Also provide corresponding timelines for achieving these milestones.

->>>>

Following our roadmap, we now have an executive overview, description of the target market, product features and development milestones:

Executive Overview:
{{step_1}}

Target Market Description:
{{step_2}}

Product Features:
{{step_3}}

Product Development Milestones:
{{step_4}}

Now we need to highlight and discuss any critical dependencies, risks, and mitigation strategies relevant to the agriculture industry. Examples could include potential regulatory changes, weather-related risks, or supply chain disruptions.
