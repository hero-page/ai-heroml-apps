# Blockchain Project Proposal Creator

Blockchain Project Proposal Creator is an AI-driven app for creating extensively detailed plans for your blockchain projects. Users can specify the variables in prompts and the AI generates a well-structured proposal. This blueprint outlines the project's goals, approach, resources, timeline, and potential impact, down to specifics like the technology to be developed, estimated budget, regulatory considerations, and utility. The app's unique attribute is its focus on specifically illustrating the project's value proposition and contribution to the broader blockchain industry.

## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./blockchain_project_proposal_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./blockchain_project_proposal_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./blockchain_project_proposal_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./blockchain_project_proposal_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./blockchain_project_proposal_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Blockchain Project Proposal Creator
```
Let's begin by writing a "Project Proposal" for the "Blockchain & Cryptocurrency" industry. Start the proposal with an introduction that summarizes the area of blockchain and cryptocurrency - {{blockchain_domain}} - in which the project is intended.

Here's some more context about the Project Proposal:
Blockchain Domain: {{blockchain_domain}}
Project Objectives: {{project_objectives}}
Blockchain Technology: {{blockchain_technology}}
Project Lifecycle: {{project_lifecycle}}
Project Budget: {{project_budget}}

->>>>

We have drafted an introduction that summarizes the specified segment of the blockchain industry:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Now, present a problem statement that identifies the issues, challenges or opportunities in the {{blockchain_domain}} that this project aims to tackle.

->>>>

We have identified and outlined the issues, challenges, and opportunities in the {{blockchain_domain}}:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Problem Statement:
{{step_2}}

Next, document the project's objectives. Detail what the project aims to achieve in the context of the identified problem, i.e., {{project_objectives}}.

->>>>

Here are the specific objectives of the project given the outlined issues in the {{blockchain_domain}}:

Problem Statement:
{{step_2}}

Project Objectives:
{{step_3}}

Now, let's specify the unique technology or methodology - {{blockchain_technology}} - that will be developed or used to accomplish these objectives.

->>>>

With the set objectives, we have chosen a unique blockchain technology or methodology to achieve those:

Project Objectives:
{{step_3}}

Blockchain Technology or Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Next, let's break down the project's lifecycle: outlining key steps and estimating the timeline for the implementation of the project.

->>>>

We have detailed the steps and timeline for the implementation of the blockchain project:

Blockchain Technology or Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Project Lifecycle:
{{step_5}}

Now, identify and state any potential risks or hurdles during the project development. Also, specify how these will be managed or mitigated.

->>>>

We have assessed potential risks and their mitigation strategies during the project:

Project Lifecycle:
{{step_5}}

Risk Management:
{{step_6}}

Next, provide an estimation of the project budget and a list of resources required for implementation. This will provide a clear picture of the project's financial requirements.

->>>>

Let's look at the project's budget and resource needs:

Risk Management:
{{step_6}}

Budget and Resources:
{{step_7}}

Now, let's give any details about potential partnerships or collaborations with the blockchain community that can enhance the relevance and credibility of the project.

->>>>

Below are the potential partnerships or collaborations that will enhance the project's relevance:

Budget and Resources:
{{step_7}}

Partnerships and Collaborations:
{{step_8}}

Next, add any related legal or regulatory considerations in the {{blockchain_domain}} that might impact the project.

->>>>

We have identified related legal and regulatory considerations:
