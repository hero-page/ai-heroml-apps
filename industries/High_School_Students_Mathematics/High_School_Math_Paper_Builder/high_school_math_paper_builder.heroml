Your task is to write a "Research Paper" for "High School Students - Mathematics", specifically for a "Student". 
Let's kick off the "Research Paper" by creating an abstract that summarises the entire paper: {{paper_summary}}.

Here's some more context about the Research Paper:
Paper Summary: {{paper_summary}}
Math Concept: {{math_concept}}
Research Results: {{research_results}}
Conclusion: {{conclusion}}

->>>>

We are writing a research paper for high school math students. We have started with an abstract for our paper:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Next, let's introduce the mathematical concept or problem we plan to explore: {{math_concept}}. Explain why this concept or problem is relevant and how it connects with previous research or real-life applications.

->>>>

Our research paper for high school math students has an abstract and an introduction:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Now, prepare the literature review. Highlight and evaluate previous studies or mathematical proofs that pertain to {{math_concept}}, and comment on any gaps your research will fill.

->>>>

We have the abstract, introduction, and the literature review for our research paper:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

After that, describe your methodology. Explain how you will investigate or troubleshoot {{math_concept}}, elaborate on the mathematical theories or formulas you used, and justify why you chose these tools.

->>>>

Our research paper's methodology part is ready. We now have an abstract, introduction, literature review, and methodology:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Now, conduct your research or experiments according to the methodology and record the results: {{research_results}}.

->>>>

With the research results, our research paper now includes an abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, and research results:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Research Results:
{{step_5}}

Next, discuss the results of your experiments or research, comparing them with the previous study and exploring what new insights your {{research_results}} add to the discipline.

->>>>

After discussing the results, our research paper now includes an abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, results, and a discussion:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Results:
{{step_5}}

Discussion:
{{step_6}}

The final section of your "Research Paper" should be the conclusion. Write a conclusion that encapsulates the research process, from your initial hypothesis to the results and their significance: {{conclusion}}.

->>>>

Our research paper includes a conclusion in addition to the abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, results, and discussion:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Results:
{{step_5}}

Discussion:
{{step_6}}

Conclusion:
{{step_7}}

A list of references is crucial. Include all the sources you consulted while researching and writing your paper.

->>>>

Now, our research paper also includes references:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Results:
{{step_5}}

Discussion:
{{step_6}}

Conclusion:
{{step_7}}

References:
{{step_8}}

In the paper, wherever possible, use real-life scenarios to explain your {{math_concept}} or problems. This will make your paper more engaging and easier to understand for your peers.
