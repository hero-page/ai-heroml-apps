Write a "Research Methodology" for the "Grant Writing - Research Institutions" industry, specifically for a "Researcher". 

Firstly, begin by introducing the research topic: {{research_topic}}. 
Provide a contextual background and emphasize the importance of the research project, clarifying its relation to the field of study.

Here's some more context about the Research Methodology:
Research Topic: {{research_topic}}
Research Objectives: {{research_objectives}}
Research Questions Or Hypotheses: {{research_questions_or_hypotheses}}

->>>>

We have an introductory passage that lays out the research topic:

Research Topic Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Now, establish your research objectives: {{research_objectives}}. 
Clearly articulate what you intend to accomplish through the course of your research.

->>>>

Having introduced the research topic:

Research Topic Introduction:
{{step_1}}

We now have laid-out research objectives:

Research Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Next, present your research questions or hypotheses: {{research_questions_or_hypotheses}}. 
These should be a direct reflection of what you aim to answer or validate through your research.

->>>>

We have defined our research objectives:

Research Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Here are the research questions or hypotheses that we intend to address:

Research Questions or Hypotheses:
{{step_3}}

Describe your research design next. 
This should include the delineation of whether your study will be qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-method, and why this selection is made in relation to your {{research_topic}}. 
Furthermore, explain how this design will assist in answering your {{research_questions_or_hypotheses}}.

->>>>

Following defined research questions or hypotheses:

Research Questions or Hypotheses:
{{step_3}}

Here's the detailed research design:

Research Design:
{{step_4}}

Next, provide a comprehensive detail about your data collection methods. 
Identify your sources, the kinds of data you'll gather, and the methods utilized to collect it. 
These details should abide by your study design and help achieve your {{research_objectives}}. 
If there are unique industry specific methodologies, such as certain lab practices or predictive modeling software, incorporate those here.

Having sketched out our research design:

Research Design:
{{step_4}}

Here's the comprehensive detail about the data collection methods:

Data Collection Details:
{{step_5}}

Now, explain the methods of data analysis you intend to use. 
Describe how you will parse your data to derive insights that answer your {{research_questions_or_hypotheses}}. 
If there are unique industry analysis techniques, like particular statistical methods or data visualization techniques, incorporate them here.

->>>>

Having detailed our data collection methods:

Data Collection Details:
{{step_5}}

Here's a description of the methods of data analysis we intend to use:

Data Analysis Methods:
{{step_6}}

Discuss the ethical considerations relevant to your research methodology, given the {{research_topic}}. 
If there are particular ethical norms or guidelines in your field, they should be included in this section.

->>>>

Building upon the data analysis methods identified:

Data Analysis Methods:
{{step_6}}

Here's the discussion of ethical considerations involved in this research:

Ethical Considerations:
{{step_7}}

Now, detail any potential limitations inherent to your research methodology.

->>>>

After discussing the ethical considerations:

Ethical Considerations:
{{step_7}}

Here are the potential limitations of the research methodology:

Methodology limitations:
{{step_8}}

Finally, wrap up by summarizing key points about the {{research_topic}}, {{research_objectives}}, and the methodology's capability to address them, as well as its potential benefits for the industry.
