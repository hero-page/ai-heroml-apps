Your task is to write a "Program Proposal" for the "Grant Writing - Education Institutions" industry, specifically for a "School Administrator". Let's begin the Program Proposal with an Executive Summary that succinctly communicates key details such as the program's purpose, target audience, expected benefits, and budget. Also mention the problem or issue a school is facing and how the program will address it: {{school_issue}}.

Here's some more context about the Program Proposal:
School Issue: {{school_issue}}
Beneficiaries: {{beneficiaries}}
Evaluation Metrics: {{evaluation_metrics}}
Sustainability Plan: {{sustainability_plan}}

For our "Program Proposal", we have generated the following Executive Summary:
