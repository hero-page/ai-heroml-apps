Your task is to write a "Maintenance Guide" for the "Hardware Documentation" industry, specifically for a "Technical Writer". 
Let's start by writing an introduction which gives a high-level overview of the hardware product the guide refers to and explains the purpose of the "Maintenance Guide". Remember to title this segment as {{maintenance_purpose}}.

Here's some more context about the Maintenance Guide:
Maintenance Purpose: {{maintenance_purpose}}
Necessary Tools And Safety: {{necessary_tools_and_safety}}
Maintenance Procedure: {{maintenance_procedure}}
Troubleshooting Advice: {{troubleshooting_advice}}
Industry Experience: {{industry_experience}}
Customer Support: {{customer_support}}

Now we have an introduction for our "Maintenance Guide":

Maintenance Purpose:
{{step_1}}

Next, compile a list of necessary tools and safety measures that should be considered when performing maintenance tasks on the specified hardware product. Let's title this segment as {{necessary_tools_and_safety}}.

We have the introduction, and a list of necessary tools and safety measures for maintenance tasks:

Maintenance Purpose:
{{step_1}}

Necessary Tools and Safety Measures:
{{step_2}}

Now, describe a step-by-step procedure for each maintenance task associated with the hardware product. Explain how each task is carried out, the precautions necessary, and expected results. This segment should be titled as {{maintenance_procedure}}.
