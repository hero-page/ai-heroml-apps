# AI Model Deep-Dive Writer

The AI Model Deep-Dive Writer app is your ultimate guide for a thorough understanding of AI/ML models. With an emphasis on user's variable inputs, this app uses AI to craft detailed, high-quality content about AI/ML models, including their background, design principles, construction, testing, applications, limitations, and areas for improvement. AI researchers will appreciate the depth of information provided, including industry jargon and systems, which aid in exploring complex concepts.

## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./ai_model_deep_dive_writer.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./ai_model_deep_dive_writer.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./ai_model_deep_dive_writer.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./ai_model_deep_dive_writer.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./ai_model_deep_dive_writer.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for AI Model Deep-Dive Writer
```
Your task is to write a "Model Description" for the "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning" industry, specifically for an "AI Researcher". 

Start off by generating an introductory paragraph that gives a brief background of the model: {{model_background}}. Explain the purpose or the need that the model fulfills in the AI & Machine Learning industry, which aligns with the interests of the AI Researcher.

Here's some more context about the Model Description:
Model Background: {{model_background}}
Model Theory: {{model_theory}}
Model Building: {{model_building}}
Model Testing: {{model_testing}}
Model Benefits: {{model_benefits}}
Model Limitations: {{model_limitations}}

->>>>

Now we have an introduction that provides the background and purpose of the model:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, let's delve into the underlying theory or principles of your model: {{model_theory}}. Ensure it addresses the mathematical, computational or logical basis of the model in a way that is understandable and interesting for an AI Researcher.

->>>>

We now have the theories and principles of the model explained:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Model Theory:
{{step_2}}

Proceed on to a section that describes the process of building and training the model: {{model_building}}. You should detail the data used, how data was handled, algorithmic details for the model's training process, feature selection, and other technical details relevant for the AI Researcher.

->>>>

We now have the processes of building and training the AI model:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Model Theory:
{{step_2}}

Model Building:
{{step_3}}

Next, establish a part that discloses how the model was tested and validated: {{model_testing}}. This should encompass testing strategies used, performance metrics evaluated, and how the model stood against them.

->>>>

We have describe the model's testing and validation process:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Model Building:
{{step_3}}

Model Testing:
{{step_4}}

Following along, let's create a segment that discusses the benefits and potential applications of the model in the real-world: {{model_benefits}}. Provide tangible examples of how the AI model could be efficiently used and what problems it can solve.

->>>>

We now have details about the benefits and applications of the model:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Model Testing:
{{step_4}}

Model Benefits:
{{step_5}}

Finally, end with a component that reveals the limitations and possible improvements of the model: {{model_limitations}}. Discuss the limitations, potential challenges of deploying your model and how these might be addressed in future iterations or research.
