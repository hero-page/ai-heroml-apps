## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./childrens_story_dialogue_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./childrens_story_dialogue_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./childrens_story_dialogue_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./childrens_story_dialogue_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./childrens_story_dialogue_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Children's Story Dialogue Creator
```
Your task is to write a character dialogue for the children's literature writing industry, specifically for an author. 
Let's begin by crafting an introduction that provides background information about the characters involved based on {{character_information}}. Remember to include age, personality traits, and any other relevant characteristics that will inform their dialogue.

Here's some more context about the Character Dialogue:
Character Information: {{character_information}}
Story Progression: {{story_progression}}
Childrens Literature Elements: {{childrens_literature_elements}}
Target Age: {{target_age}}
Dialogue End Goal: {{dialogue_end_goal}}

->>>>

Now that we have introduced our characters, we have:

Character Information:
{{step_1}}

Next, to ensure the dialogue aligns with the general progression of the story: {{story_progression}}, describe the series of events that this dialogue will follow.

->>>>

Now we have the story progression and character information to guide our dialogue:

Character Information:
{{step_1}}

Story Progression:
{{step_2}}

Based on these, now let's create the character's dialogue that reflects their personality, age, and characteristics you noted earlier: {{step_1}}. Align the content, tone, and vocabulary of character's speech accordingly.

->>>>

So far, we have created the story progression and a dialogue that reflects our character's attributes:

Story Progression:
{{step_2}}

Character Dialogue:
{{step_3}}

Now, for each line of the dialogue crafted until now, make sure it serves a purpose related to the characters' development or the plot progression: {{step_2}}. Edit the dialogue as needed to avoid unnecessary exchanges.

->>>>

Now we have purposeful character dialogues as per the story progression:

Character Dialogue:
{{step_4}}

Next, let's incorporate elements of humor, moral lessons, or curiosity based on {{childrens_literature_elements}}. Modify the dialogue to include these elements, as appropriate for children's literature.

->>>>

Our character dialogue is now enhanced with elements of children's literature:

Character Dialogue:
{{step_5}}

It's time to check the dialogue for language appropriateness considering the targeted age group: {{target_age}}. Modify the dialogue to ensure the language complexity matches the reading ability of the target demographic.
