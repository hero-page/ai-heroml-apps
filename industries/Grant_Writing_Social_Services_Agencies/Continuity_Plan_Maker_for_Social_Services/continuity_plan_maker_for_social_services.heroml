Your task is to write a "Continuity Plan" for the "Grant Writing - Social Services Agencies" industry, specifically for an "Agency Director". Let's start by generating an introduction detailing the purpose of the "Continuity Plan" and its importance for the agency's sustainability and resilience against potential disruptions.
  
Here's some more context about the Continuity Plan:
