Your task is to write a "Budget Proposal" for the "Grant Writing - Public Broadcasting" industry, specifically for a "Grant Writer". Let's begin by drafting an abstract or executive summary that provides an overview of the project: {{project_overview}}, and explains why the grant is needed.

Here's some more context about the Budget Proposal:
Project Overview: {{project_overview}}
Program Title: {{program_title}}
Program Audience And Impact: {{program_audience_and_impact}}
Program Costs: {{program_costs}}
Budget Justification: {{budget_justification}}
Sustainability Plan: {{sustainability_plan}}

->>>>

We have an executive summary that outlines our project and the necessity of the grant:

Abstract/Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Next, introduce the program to be proposed, the title you are assigning {{program_title}}, how it will address the audience, its likely impact {{program_audience_and_impact}}, and detail its scope.

We now have a program proposal for our grant:

Program Proposal:
{{step_2}}

With the program firmly established, let's proceed to the budget narrative. Here, specify the program's financial needs, including staff costs, production expenses, marketing efforts, and any other industry-specific costs: {{program_costs}}.

->>>>

Our initial budget narrative, detailing the necessary expenses for our program, is as follows:

Budget Narrative:
{{step_3}}

Having defined the overall costs, let's now break these down into detailed categories. Urge the AI to explain the justification for each line item within the budget: {{budget_justification}}.

->>>>

Our detailed budget, along with justification for each line item, now looks like this:

Budget Breakdown and Justification:
{{step_4}}

Moving on, describe the sustainability plan of the project, detailing how funds will be managed effectively and responsibly, and how the project can continue beyond the period of the grant: {{sustainability_plan}}.
