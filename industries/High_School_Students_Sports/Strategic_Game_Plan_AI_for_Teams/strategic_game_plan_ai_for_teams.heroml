Your task is to write a "Game Strategy" for the "High School Students - Sports" industry, specifically for a "Team Captain". 

Let's begin by writing a motivational introduction that briefly explains the purpose of the game strategy for the game: {{game}}. The team captain must understand that the strategy is designed to enhance the team's performance in the game.
