Your task is to write a "Data Management Plan" for the "Grant Writing - Research Institutions" industry, for a "Researcher". 

Let's begin with an introduction. 

Explain the project's research problem: {{research_problem}}. This should provide the context for the 'Data Management Plan', highlighting the importance and relevance of effective data management to the research question.

Here's some more context about the Data Management Plan:
Research Problem: {{research_problem}}
Data Types: {{data_types}}
Data Documentation Methods: {{data_documentation_methods}}
Data Storage And Protection: {{data_storage_and_protection}}
Data Sharing And Access: {{data_sharing_and_access}}
Data Reuse And Preservation: {{data_reuse_and_preservation}}
Roles And Responsibilities: {{roles_and_responsibilities}}
Data Management Plan Budget: {{data_management_plan_budget}}
Data Management Plan Summary: {{data_management_plan_summary}}

->>>>

This is the introduction to our "Data Management Plan": 

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

The next step is to identify and describe the types of data that will be generated or collected in your project: {{data_types}}. Describe the methods used for data collection, and explain why these methods are appropriate for your research problem.

->>>>

The introduction to the Data Management Plan is:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

The collected data and the involved methodologies are:

Data Collection:
{{step_2}}

Moving on, detail how the collected data will be documented and organized: {{data_documentation_methods}}. Consider the data standards and the metadata that will be used to annotate the data, ensuring it can be understood and used properly in the future.

->>>>

For our Data Management Plan, we have defined the collection process and the subsequent documentation approach:

Data Collection:
{{step_2}}

Data Documentation and Metadata:
{{step_3}}

Next, discuss how the data will be safely stored and protected: {{data_storage_and_protection}}. Include details about physical storage solutions, digital security measures, backup protocols, and access restrictions.

->>>>

In the Data Management Plan, this is how the data is documented, and stored and protected:

Data Documentation and Metadata:
{{step_3}}

Data Storage and Protection:
{{step_4}}

Then, explain how data will be shared and who will have access to it: {{data_sharing_and_access}}. Detail any limitations to data accessibility due to ethical considerations, participant confidentiality, or proprietary data use agreements.

->>>>

This is how we are planning on storing, protecting, and providing access to the data:

Data Storage and Protection:
{{step_4}}

Data Access and Sharing:
{{step_5}}

Next, discuss your plans for long-term data preservation and how this data can be re-used in future research: {{data_reuse_and_preservation}}.

->>>>

The plan for granting access to the data and the provisions for its reuse and preservation are:

Data Access and Sharing:
{{step_5}}

Data Re-usage and Long-term Preservation:
{{step_6}}

Detail roles and responsibilities for all stages of data management: {{roles_and_responsibilities}}. Remember to include information about the person or team responsible for each stage of the data management life-cycle.

->>>>

The protocols defined for reusing the data, alongside the roles & responsibilities during the data management processes, are:

Data Re-usage and Long-term Preservation:
{{step_6}}

Roles and Responsibilities:
{{step_7}}

Provide an estimate of costs associated with implementing this data management plan: {{data_management_plan_budget}}.

->>>>

The identified roles and responsibilities during data management and the estimated budget are:

Roles and Responsibilities:
{{step_7}}

Budget:
{{step_8}}

To wrap up the "Data Management Plan", end with a summary that reiterates the main processes and procedures. In this section, emphasize the beneficial impact of proper data management on your research problem and the broader scientific community: {{data_management_plan_summary}}.
