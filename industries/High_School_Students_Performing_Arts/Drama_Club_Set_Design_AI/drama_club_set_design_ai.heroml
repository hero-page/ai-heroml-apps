Creating a "Set Design Description" in the "High School Students - Performing Arts" industry for a "Drama Club Member". 
Let's start by writing an introduction that provides the context of the stage play: {{play_context}}. This should include the name of the play, its genre, and a brief overview of its general plot.

Here's some more context about the Set Design Description:
