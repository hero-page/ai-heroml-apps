Your task is to write a "Sustainability Statement" for the "Grant Writing - Public Broadcasting" industry, specifically for a "Broadcast Manager". 

Let's start with an introduction that describes the purpose of the "Sustainability Statement". 

The introduction should include your station's commitment to sustainable practices in a broad context. Remember to use the dynamic variable {{station_sustainability_commitment}} to specify your approach towards sustainability and why it's vital for your specific station.

Here's some more context about the Sustainability Statement:
Station Sustainability Commitment: {{station_sustainability_commitment}}
Station Sustainability Goals: {{station_sustainability_goals}}
Station Sustainability Practices: {{station_sustainability_practices}}
Sustainability Impact Assessment: {{sustainability_impact_assessment}}
Future Sustainability Plans: {{future_sustainability_plans}}

Now, we have an introduction for our "Sustainability Statement":

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, let's state the station's general sustainability goals. 

These goals should clearly outline the environmental, social, or economic sustainability goals the station aims to achieve. Consider including an assertion of the commitment to reduce environmental footprint, promote diversity and inclusivity, or enhance economic viability. 

Ensure you incorporate the dynamic variable {{station_sustainability_goals}} to specify these exact goals.

Use the dynamic variable {{future_sustainability_plans}} to describe such future plans.
