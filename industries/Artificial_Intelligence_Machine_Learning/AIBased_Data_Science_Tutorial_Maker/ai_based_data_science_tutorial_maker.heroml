Your task is to write a "Tutorial" for the "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning" industry, specifically tailored for a "Data Scientist". Let's begin with an introduction that briefly outlines the main goal: {{main_goal}}.

Here's some more context about the Tutorial:
Main Goal: {{main_goal}}

->>>>

Now we have our introduction for this tutorial:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, create the first module introducing basic concepts and terminologies of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning crucial to the data science field. Ensure that these concepts are applicable to the {{main_goal}}.

->>>>

For our tutorial, we now have the introduction and the first module:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 (Basics):
{{step_2}}

Moving forward, let's develop the second module that elaborates on more advanced topics relevant to the {{main_goal}} such as natural language processing, deep learning, reinforcement learning among others.

->>>>

Our tutorial now comprises the introduction, the basic module, and an advanced module:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 (Basics):
{{step_2}}

Module 2 (Advanced Topics):
{{step_3}}

Next, design a module that provides a walkthrough of a real-life example or case study associated with the {{main_goal}}, to illustrate the application of theoretical knowledge in practical industry contexts.

->>>>

Thus far, we have the introduction, basic concepts module, advanced topics module, and a case study module:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 (Basics):
{{step_2}}

Module 2 (Advanced Topics):
{{step_3}}

Module 3 (Case Study):
{{step_4}}

Design the fourth module dedicated to the statistical tools and programming languages used by a Data Scientist to handle data and develop predictive models. Include step-by-step instructions linked to the {{main_goal}}.

->>>>

Now, our tutorial includes an introduction, basic and advanced topics modules, a case study module and a module on tools and languages:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 (Basics):
{{step_2}}

Module 2 (Advanced Topics):
{{step_3}}

Module 3 (Case Study):
{{step_4}}

Module 4 (Tools & Languages):
{{step_5}}

Now include an interactive task, problem or assignment at the end of each module that reinforces key learning points, relating to the {{main_goal}}.

->>>>

Our tutorial now comprises an introduction, four modules, and interactive tasks:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 and Task:
{{step_2}}, {{step_6}}

Module 2 and Task:
{{step_3}}, {{step_7}}

Module 3 and Task:
{{step_4}}, {{step_8}}

Module 4 and Task:
{{step_5}}, {{step_9}}

Next, create a module for review and discussion where learners can reflect, provide feedback, express difficulties, and inspire further exploration. Make sure this module relates to the {{main_goal}} of the tutorial.

->>>>

Our tutorial now comprises an introduction, four modules with tasks, and a review and discussion module:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 and Task:
{{step_2}}, {{step_6}}

Module 2 and Task:
{{step_3}}, {{step_7}}

Module 3 and Task:
{{step_4}}, {{step_8}}

Module 4 and Task:
{{step_5}}, {{step_9}}

Review & Discussion Module:
{{step_10}}

Finally, wrap up our tutorial with a summary that reiterates the {{main_goal}} and the main takeaways from each module, providing closure for the learner.
