## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./ai_feature_announcement_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./ai_feature_announcement_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./ai_feature_announcement_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./ai_feature_announcement_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./ai_feature_announcement_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for AI Feature Announcement Creator
```
Let's create a "Feature Announcement" for the "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning" industry, specifically for a "Product Manager". 

To give a proper context, we start with an intriguing title. The title should captivate interest at first glance and be a brief summary of the important essence of the feature. For example, “Introducing {{feature_name}}”.

Here's some more context about the Feature Announcement:
Feature Name: {{feature_name}}
Current Product: {{current_product}}
AI Technology: {{AI_technology}}

->>>>

Now that we have a title for our feature announcement:

Title:
{{step_1}}

Next let's pen an introductory paragraph that briefly explains what the new feature is and its significance. For instance, "We're thrilled to announce the launch of our new feature, {{feature_name}}, that promises to revolutionize..."

->>>>

With the title ready, we now also have an introductory paragraph:

Title:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Following the introduction, it's time to define the feature - explain how this feature is used and in what context, which sets the situation for the feature's application, like "{{feature_name}} enables you to..."

->>>>

The details of the feature look like this:

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

What Feature Does:
{{step_3}}

Based on the definition of the feature, let's describe its core benefits. Tell how it technologically enhances the existing product, but make sure to use language familiar to the industry: "The {{feature_name}} takes {{current_product}} to the next level by..."

->>>>

Now the benefits of the feature have been articulated as:

What Feature Does:
{{step_3}}

Benefits of the Feature:
{{step_4}}

Once the benefits are clear, let's outline the technical aspects of the feature. Aspects might include underlying AI/ML technologies, algorithms used, data required, accuracy of the feature, etc. Underscore the uniqueness of the product in the telling: "Built on the strength of {{AI_technology}}, the {{feature_name}} guarantees unparalleled efficiency..."

->>>>

With the benefits ready, the technical details of the feature are also complete:

Benefits of the Feature:
{{step_4}}

Technical Details:
{{step_5}}

Given the technical aspects of our feature, it's now time to talk about the user-faced elements. Mention how the feature can improve user experience, streamline workflow or increase productivity: "With {{feature_name}}, our users will be able to..."

->>>>

Based on the technical details, we have user-centric details as well for the new feature:

Technical Details:
{{step_5}}

User-centric Details:
{{step_6}}

Now, let's focus on the development process of this feature, including hurdles overcome, AI/ML model training, testing done, etc: "To develop {{feature_name}}, we..."

->>>>

Given the user-focused aspects of the feature, a summary of its development process might look like this:

User-centric Details:
{{step_6}}

Development Process:
{{step_7}}

After the development story has been told, we should conclude the announcement. Reiterate the significance of the new feature and its benefits to the users, and include a call-to-action: "Experience the power of {{feature_name}} today..."

->>>>

Now that the development process has been explained, we have a conclusion that sums up all the aspects of the announcement:

Development Process:
{{step_7}}

Conclusion:
{{step_8}}

To wrap up, let's provide contact information or channels that customers can access for further details or to ask questions: "For more information about {{feature_name}}, reach out to us at..."
