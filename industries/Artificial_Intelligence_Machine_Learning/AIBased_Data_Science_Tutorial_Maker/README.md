## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./ai_based_data_science_tutorial_maker.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./ai_based_data_science_tutorial_maker.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./ai_based_data_science_tutorial_maker.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./ai_based_data_science_tutorial_maker.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./ai_based_data_science_tutorial_maker.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for AI-Based Data Science Tutorial Maker
```
Your task is to write a "Tutorial" for the "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning" industry, specifically tailored for a "Data Scientist". Let's begin with an introduction that briefly outlines the main goal: {{main_goal}}.

Here's some more context about the Tutorial:
Main Goal: {{main_goal}}

->>>>

Now we have our introduction for this tutorial:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, create the first module introducing basic concepts and terminologies of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning crucial to the data science field. Ensure that these concepts are applicable to the {{main_goal}}.

->>>>

For our tutorial, we now have the introduction and the first module:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 (Basics):
{{step_2}}

Moving forward, let's develop the second module that elaborates on more advanced topics relevant to the {{main_goal}} such as natural language processing, deep learning, reinforcement learning among others.

->>>>

Our tutorial now comprises the introduction, the basic module, and an advanced module:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 (Basics):
{{step_2}}

Module 2 (Advanced Topics):
{{step_3}}

Next, design a module that provides a walkthrough of a real-life example or case study associated with the {{main_goal}}, to illustrate the application of theoretical knowledge in practical industry contexts.

->>>>

Thus far, we have the introduction, basic concepts module, advanced topics module, and a case study module:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 (Basics):
{{step_2}}

Module 2 (Advanced Topics):
{{step_3}}

Module 3 (Case Study):
{{step_4}}

Design the fourth module dedicated to the statistical tools and programming languages used by a Data Scientist to handle data and develop predictive models. Include step-by-step instructions linked to the {{main_goal}}.

->>>>

Now, our tutorial includes an introduction, basic and advanced topics modules, a case study module and a module on tools and languages:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 (Basics):
{{step_2}}

Module 2 (Advanced Topics):
{{step_3}}

Module 3 (Case Study):
{{step_4}}

Module 4 (Tools & Languages):
{{step_5}}

Now include an interactive task, problem or assignment at the end of each module that reinforces key learning points, relating to the {{main_goal}}.

->>>>

Our tutorial now comprises an introduction, four modules, and interactive tasks:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 and Task:
{{step_2}}, {{step_6}}

Module 2 and Task:
{{step_3}}, {{step_7}}

Module 3 and Task:
{{step_4}}, {{step_8}}

Module 4 and Task:
{{step_5}}, {{step_9}}

Next, create a module for review and discussion where learners can reflect, provide feedback, express difficulties, and inspire further exploration. Make sure this module relates to the {{main_goal}} of the tutorial.

->>>>

Our tutorial now comprises an introduction, four modules with tasks, and a review and discussion module:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Module 1 and Task:
{{step_2}}, {{step_6}}

Module 2 and Task:
{{step_3}}, {{step_7}}

Module 3 and Task:
{{step_4}}, {{step_8}}

Module 4 and Task:
{{step_5}}, {{step_9}}

Review & Discussion Module:
{{step_10}}

Finally, wrap up our tutorial with a summary that reiterates the {{main_goal}} and the main takeaways from each module, providing closure for the learner.
