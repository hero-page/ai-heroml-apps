Your task is to write a "Cultivation Report" for the "Cannabis Industry". 
Start by writing an executive summary that provides an overview of the cultivation cycle: {{cultivation cycle}}. This should briefly touch on the highlights of each section in the report.

Here's some more context about the Cultivation Report:

->>>>

We have an executive summary for our Cultivation Report:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Now, write an introduction providing a clear definition of the cannabis strain being cultivated: {{cannabis strain}}. You should outline the unique qualities and potential yields of this particular strain.

->>>>

We are drafting a Cultivation Report and have written an introduction for our cannabis strain:

Introduction - Cannabis Strain:
{{step_2}}

Next, details about the growing medium used: {{growing medium}} are required. This section will explain the choice of medium and its potential benefits for the crop's growth and yield.

->>>>

In our Cultivation Report, we have specified the growing medium characteristics:

Growing Medium:
{{step_3}}

Moving on, we need to describe the cultivation process, including critical variables such as light, temperature, and watering schedules, as well as pest and disease management strategies.  Be sure to describe any specific cultivation techniques employed, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, or conventional soil-based cultivation.

->>>>

In the Cultivation Report, we have detailed the cultivation process so far:

Cultivation Process:
{{step_4}}

Let's now write about the harvesting process, focusing on the approximate age at harvest: {{age at harvest}} and the specific cues used to determine the ideal harvest time.

->>>>

We have outlined the harvesting process in our Cultivation Report:

Harvesting Process:
{{step_5}}

It's time to discuss the drying and curing process. This should include detailed descriptions of the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, darkness), duration, and methods used for both drying and curing.

->>>>

Our Cultivation Report now includes a section on the drying and curing process:

Drying & Curing Process:
{{step_6}}

Next, we will write a section detailing the tests and results regarding the chemical profile of the harvested cannabis, primarily focusing on potency, cannabinoid profile, and contaminant testing.

->>>>

We have covered the testing of harvested cannabis in our Cultivation Report:

Cannabis Testing:
{{step_7}}

To conclude, let's provide a comprehensive review of the cultivation cycle, pointing out any challenges encountered, lessons learned, and potential improvements for future cultivation cycles. The scope for proposals regarding the next cultivation cycle changes or tweaks can be included here.
