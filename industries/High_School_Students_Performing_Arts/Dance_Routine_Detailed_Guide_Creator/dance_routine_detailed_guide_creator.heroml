Your task is to write a "Dance Routine Description" for the "High School Students - Performing Arts" industry, specifically for a "Student". 
To get started, create an introduction that explains the purpose of this routine.

Here's some more context about the Dance Routine Description:

Dance Style: {{dance_style}}
Sequence Details: {{sequence_details}}
Music Cues: {{music_cues}}
Expressive Elements: {{expressive_elements}}

For our Dance Routine Description, we have an introduction that outlines the purpose of the routine:

Up to this point, our Dance Routine Description includes an introduction and a brief synopsis of the dance style:
