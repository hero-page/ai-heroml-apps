Your task is to write a "Service Script" for the "Customer Service & Support" industry, specific to a "Customer Service Rep". 
Begin by crafting an introduction that warmly greets the customer, affirms the company's commitment to service quality, and introduces the representative, referred to as {{rep_intro}}.

Here's some more context about the Service Script:
Rep Intro: {{rep_intro}}
Customer Verification: {{customer_verification}}
Customer Query Description: {{customer_query_description}}

Escalation Management: {{escalation_management}}
Ending Interaction: {{ending_interaction}}
