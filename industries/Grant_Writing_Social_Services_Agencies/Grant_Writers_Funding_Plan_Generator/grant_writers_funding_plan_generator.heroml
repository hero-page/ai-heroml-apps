Begin writing a "Funding Plan" in the "Grant Writing - Social Services Agencies" industry for a "Grant Writer". Your task is to write an executive summary capturing an overview of the funding plan (we'll call it {{funding_overview}}). 
This should touch on the amount required, the sources to be approached, and the overall strategy for securing the funds.

Here's some more context about the Funding Plan:
Funding Overview: {{funding_overview}}
Organization Info: {{organization_info}}
Funding Needs Detail: {{funding_needs_detail}}
Potential Funding Sources: {{potential_funding_sources}}
Fund Securing Strategy: {{fund_securing_strategy}}
Projected Timeline: {{projected_timeline}}
Next Steps: {{next_steps}}

Having written the summary, continue in the "Funding Plan":

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Next, incorporate into the plan, detailed information about your organization. The details should include your organization's mission, vision, and services offered, and be summarized into the variable {{organization_info}}.

Next, you're to provide comprehensive details on the specific funding needs. These should vary depending on the services your agency provides but be sure to structure them according to {{funding_needs_detail}} which includes the purpose of the funding, the amount required, and the expected impact.
