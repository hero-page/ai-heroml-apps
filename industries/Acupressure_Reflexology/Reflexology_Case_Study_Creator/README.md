## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./reflexology_case_study_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./reflexology_case_study_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./reflexology_case_study_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./reflexology_case_study_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./reflexology_case_study_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Reflexology Case Study Creator
```
Your task is to write a "Client Anonymized Case Study" for the "Acupressure & Reflexology" industry, specifically for a "Reflexologist". 

We start by introducing our client. Remember, we do not include any personal identification information. 
Instead, focus on their health history and lifestyle, concluding with a summary of the condition of the patient before seeking therapy: {{pre_therapy_condition}}.

Here's some more context about the Client Anonymized Case Study:
Pre Therapy Condition: {{pre_therapy_condition}}
Therapeutic Goal: {{therapeutic_goal}}
Reflexology Techniques: {{reflexology_techniques}}
Progression Account: {{progression_account}}
Post Therapy Condition: {{post_therapy_condition}}
Benefits Of Treatment: {{benefits_of_treatment}}
Key Learnings: {{key_learnings}}

->>>>

With the client's background and pre-therapy condition established, let's detail the therapeutic goal set by the reflexologist, considering the client's initial condition. 

Client Background and Pre-Therapy Condition:
{{step_1}}

->>>>

We have the client background and the therapeutic goal set:

Client Background and Pre-Therapy Condition:
{{step_1}}

Therapeutic goal:
{{step_2}}

Now, describe the specific reflexology techniques employed to help the client, ensuring you explain the rationale behind these chosen techniques within the context of the client's health history and specific health issues.

->>>>

Our case study currently includes the client background, therapeutic goal, and the employed reflexology techniques:

Client Background and Pre-Therapy Condition:
{{step_1}}

Therapeutic goal:
{{step_2}}

Reflexology Techniques:
{{step_3}}

Next, detail an account of the client's progression throughout the treatment. Include all changes, improvements, potential challenges encountered, and any modifications needed during the therapy.

->>>>

We have a clear snapshot of our case including client background, therapeutic goal, employed reflexology techniques, and the progression account:

Client Background and Pre-Therapy Condition:
{{step_1}}

Therapeutic goal:
{{step_2}}

Reflexology Techniques:
{{step_3}}

Progression Account:
{{step_4}}

Moving forward, document the final state of the patient after concluding the reflexology treatment, and emphasize how the employed techniques contributed to this improvement. Make sure to include comparisons between the pre-therapy and post-therapy state of the patient.

->>>>

Our case study now includes the pre-therapy and post-therapy comparison, complemented by the client's background, therapeutic goal, reflexology techniques employed, and progression account:

Pre-Therapy Condition:
{{step_1}}

Therapeutic goal:
{{step_2}}

Reflexology Techniques:
{{step_3}}

Progression Account:
{{step_4}}

Post-Therapy Condition:
{{step_5}}

Conclude the case study with a comprehensive summary underscoring the benefits and value of reflexology treatment based on our specific case.
