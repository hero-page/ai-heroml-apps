Your task is to create a "Public Consultation Summary" for the "Environmental and Natural Resources Administration" industry, specifically as a "Water Resource Specialist". To start with, let's write an introduction that specifies the purpose of the public consultation and its connection to the broader water resource management project: {{project_purpose}}. 

Here's some more context about the Public Consultation Summary:
Project Purpose: {{project_purpose}}
Resource Status: {{resource_status}}
Consultation Objectives: {{consultation_objectives}}
Engagement Methodology: {{engagement_methodology}}
Key Findings: {{key_findings}}
Findings Implementation: {{findings_implementation}}
Next Steps: {{next_steps}}
