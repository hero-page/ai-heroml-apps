Write a "Tagline Creation" for the "Brand Consultancies" industry, specifically for a "Copywriter". 
Let's begin by writing a creative brief for a "Copywriter". The brief should include: The key message to be conveyed through the tagline ({{key_message}}), a description of the target audience ({{target_audience}}), and the unique selling proposition (USP) of the product or service ({{unique_selling_proposition}}).

Here's some more context about the Tagline Creation:
Key Message: {{key_message}}
Target Audience: {{target_audience}}
Unique Selling Proposition: {{unique_selling_proposition}}
