Let's build a session guide for the "Ecotherapy & Nature Connection" industry, specifically for an "Ecotherapist". To begin, provide an introduction that presents the aim and intended learning outcomes of the ecotherapy session: {{session_aims_and_outcomes}}. This needs to involve the specific themes, activities, or experiences intended during the session.

Here's some more context about the Session Guide:
Session Aims And Outcomes: {{session_aims_and_outcomes}}
Audience Interests: {{audience_interests}}
Session Locations: {{session_locations}}
Session Activities: {{session_activities}}
Potential Challenges: {{potential_challenges}}
Evaluation Method: {{evaluation_method}}
