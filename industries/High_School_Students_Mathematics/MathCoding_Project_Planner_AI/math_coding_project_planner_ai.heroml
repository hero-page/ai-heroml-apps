Your task is to write a "Project Plan" for the "High School Students - Mathematics" industry, specifically for a "Coding Club Member". 

We will begin by generating an introductory section that specifies the project's objective: {{project_objective}}. This section should connect the project with the needs and interests of the Coding Club members.

Here's some more context about the Project Plan:
Project Objective: {{project_objective}}
Mathematical Context: {{mathematical_context}}
Coding Techniques: {{coding_techniques}}
Math Concepts: {{math_concepts}}
Members Role: {{members_role}}
Progress Metrics: {{progress_metrics}}
Learning Outcomes: {{learning_outcomes}}
Project Timeline: {{project_timeline}}
Club Benefits: {{club_benefits}}
Assessment Strategy: {{assessment_strategy}}

->>>>

Here is the initialized project plan for our Coding Club:

Objective:
{{step_1}}

Now, let's create a background context section that describes the current state of the particular element of mathematics or programming that the project will focus on: {{mathematical_context}}. This section should also contain a brief summary of what existing knowledge or programming skills are necessary for the club members to engage in the project.

->>>>

Our project plan for the Coding Club now has an objective and a background context:

Objective:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Next, let's develop a project description section that outlines the scope of the project. This should include the key math concepts and programming techniques: {{coding_techniques}} and {{math_concepts}}, that the project will explore.

->>>>

The project plan for our Coding Club continues to take shape with an objective, background context, and project description:

Objective:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Project Description:
{{step_3}}

Now, in the method section, please explain how the club members will be involved and what role they will play: {{members_role}}. Also describe how the progress of the project will be measured: {{progress_metrics}}.

->>>>

Our project plan for the Coding Club has:

Objective:
{{step_1}}

Project Description:
{{step_3}}

Method:
{{step_4}}

Next, we need to outline the learning outcomes and skills that the Coding Club members will gain from participating in the project: {{learning_outcomes}}.

->>>>

The project plan for our Coding Club includes:

Method:
{{step_4}}

Learning Outcomes:
{{step_5}}

Now, we need a timeline section for the project that includes milestones and deadlines: {{project_timeline}}. This timeline should detail specific coding tasks and math concepts that the members need to master.

->>>>

Our project plan for the Coding Club has:

Learning Outcomes:
{{step_5}}

Timeline:
{{step_6}}

Let's now move on to include a section that details how the project will benefit the club: {{club_benefits}} and how it has potential for wider impact on the school and beyond.

->>>>

Our project plan for the Coding Club, now includes:

Timeline:
{{step_6}}

Club benefits:
{{step_7}}

Finally, we need to add a feedback and evaluation section that outlines how club members' learning and the effectiveness of the project will be assessed: {{assessment_strategy}}.
