Write a "Comic Script" for the "Children's Storybooks - Comics & Graphic Novels" industry, specifically for a "Author". 

Let's start with defining the key elements of your comic: characters ({{characters}}), settings ({{settings}}), and the plot ({{plot}}).

Here's some more context about the Comic Script:

Settings: {{settings}}
Plot: {{plot}}
Character: {{character}}
