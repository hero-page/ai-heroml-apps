Your task is to generate a Book Layout Plan in the Children's Storybooks - Picture Books industry for an Art Director. 
Let's start by defining the main concept and theme of the book: {{book_theme}}. This should portray a brief description of the story along with the tone of the narrative.

Here's some more context about the Book Layout Plan:
Book Theme: {{book_theme}}
Plot Summary: {{plot_summary}}
Key Events: {{key_events}}
Character Interactions: {{character_interactions}}
Illustrative Style: {{illustrative_style}}
Page Description: {{page_description}}
Art Alignment: {{art_alignment}}
Color Scheme: {{color_scheme}}
Typography: {{typography}}
Cover Art Direction: {{cover_art_direction}}
Title Prominence: {{title_prominence}}
Back Cover Content: {{back_cover_content}}
Print Format: {{print_format}}
Dimensions: {{dimensions}}
Additional Inclusions: {{additional_inclusions}}
