Your role is to write a "Literature Review" for the "Academic & University" industry, focusing on a "Researcher". Let's begin with an introduction providing the context for the review while specifying the area of research and the research objectives: {{research_objectives}}.

Here's some more context about the Literature Review:
Research Objectives: {{research_objectives}}
Databases And Search Terms: {{databases_and_search_terms}}
Research Question: {{research_question}}
Research Contribution: {{research_contribution}}
Citation Style: {{citation_style}}

->>>>

We have started our literature review with the following introduction and research objectives:

Introduction and Research Objectives:
{{step_1}}

Now for the methodology section, discuss the ways you have sourced your information. Be sure to specify the databases used and the search terms employed: {{databases_and_search_terms}}.

->>>>

We now have our introduction, research objectives, and our methodology:

Introduction and Research Objectives:
{{step_1}}

Methodology:
{{step_2}}

Let's move towards the synthesis of your findings. Organize the results into themes or sections, ensuring each section relates to the research objectives: {{research_objectives}}.

->>>>

We have completed our introduction, objectives, methodology and now our synthesis of findings: 

Introduction and Research Objectives:
{{step_1}}

Methodology:
{{step_2}}

Synthesis of Findings:
{{step_3}}

Next, draft the interpretation section. Provide a critical analysis of the sampled literature and elaborate how your findings relate to the research question: {{research_question}}.

We now have our interpretation of the literature, and how it connects with our research question:
    
Introduction and Research Objectives:
{{step_1}}

Methodology:
{{step_2}}

Synthesis of Findings:
{{step_3}}

Interpretation:
{{step_4}}

In the conclusion section, encapsulate your findings. Point out any gaps in the existing literature, and explain how your research aims to address these gaps: {{research_contribution}}.
