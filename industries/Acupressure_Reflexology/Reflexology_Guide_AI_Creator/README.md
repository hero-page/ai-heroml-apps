## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./reflexology_guide_ai_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./reflexology_guide_ai_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./reflexology_guide_ai_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./reflexology_guide_ai_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./reflexology_guide_ai_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Reflexology Guide AI Creator
```
Let's begin by addressing the task of creating a Reflexology Session Guide for a Reflexologist in the Acupressure & Reflexology industry. The first step is to generate an introduction that provides an overview of the reflexology session, its aims, and its expected outcomes. Remember to tailor this overview to your specific session goals.

Here's some more context about the Reflexology Session Guide:
Session Goals: {{session_goals}}
Reflex Points: {{reflex_points}}
Preparation Process: {{preparation_process}}
Post Session Care: {{post_session_care}}
Client Specific Variables: {{client_specific_variables}}

->>>>

Now that we have a foundation to work with:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

The second step is to describe in detail the anatomy of feet and hands relevant to reflexology points. Identify how each reflex point corresponds to a specific organ, gland, or function of the body. Again, ensure this description aligns with your session goals.

->>>>

We've created a detailed guide on the anatomy of feet and hands related to reflexology:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Anatomy Guide:
{{step_2}}

The third step is to outline a systematic process for preparing the client before a session. This could include pre-assessments, environment setup, and comfort considerations.

->>>>

We have a systematic process for preparing clients:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Anatomy Guide:
{{step_2}}

Preparation Process:
{{step_3}}

The fourth step will be to detail a clear, step-by-step technique for the reflexology session. This guide should start from the initial relaxation techniques and continue through manipulating various reflex points, concluding with calming techniques to end the session.

->>>>

We now have a clear set of reflexology techniques:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Anatomy Guide:
{{step_2}}

Preparation Process:
{{step_3}}

Reflexology Techniques:
{{step_4}}

The fifth step involves emphasizing post-session practices, including client feedback and aftercare advice regarding hydration, rest, and potential temporary responses to the treatment.

->>>>

We've defined important post-session practices:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Anatomy Guide:
{{step_2}}

Preparation Process:
{{step_3}}

Reflexology Techniques:
{{step_4}}

Post-session Practices:
{{step_5}}

Our sixth step will integrate considerations for client-specific variables, such as age, physical condition, and pain thresholds, and detail how these factors can impact the application of pressure, duration, and focus on certain reflex points.

->>>>

We have integrated considerations for client-specific variables:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Anatomy Guide:
{{step_2}}

Preparation Process:
{{step_3}}

Reflexology Techniques:
{{step_4}}

Post-session Practices:
{{step_5}}

Client-specific Considerations:
{{step_6}}

In the seventh step, formulate troubleshooting tips to mitigate client discomfort, non-responsiveness to treatment, or unexpected reactions while performing the session.

->>>>

We have added troubleshooting advice:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Anatomy Guide:
{{step_2}}

Preparation Process:
{{step_3}}

Reflexology Techniques:
{{step_4}}

Post-session Practices:
{{step_5}}

Client-specific Considerations:
{{step_6}}

Troubleshooting Tips:
{{step_7}}

For the final step, describe how to effectively keep session records and schedule follow-up appointments. Emphasize the importance of continuity of care and progression towards the session goals.
