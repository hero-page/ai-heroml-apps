## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./hobby_instructor_lesson_plan_ai.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./hobby_instructor_lesson_plan_ai.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./hobby_instructor_lesson_plan_ai.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./hobby_instructor_lesson_plan_ai.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./hobby_instructor_lesson_plan_ai.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Hobby Instructor Lesson Plan AI
```
Your task is to write a "Lesson Plan" for the "Children's Crafts & Hobbies" industry, specifically for a "Hobby Instructor". 
Let's start by composing an introduction, presenting the key theme of the lesson: {{lesson_theme}}. This will orient the students towards what they will be learning and doing during the class.

Here's some more context about the Lesson Plan:
Lesson Theme: {{lesson_theme}}
Learning Objectives: {{learning_objectives}}

->>>>

In our "Lesson Plan" for a "Hobby Instructor", we have an introduction:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Let's now articulate the learning objectives: {{learning_objectives}}. These objectives should be straightforward, and clearly state what skills or knowledge students will acquire by the end of the lesson.

->>>>

Our lesson plan now consists of an introduction, as well as learning objectives:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

To facilitate learning, we will divide our lesson into chunks or units. Each unit should teach or focus on a specific part of the {{lesson_theme}}. It should help in retaining the students' attention and maintaining the flow of teaching.

->>>>

Our lesson plan is taking shape, with an introduction, clear learning objectives, and well-structured units:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Units:
{{step_3}}

Practical exercises or tasks that reinforce the objectives: {{learning_objectives}} are critical in any lesson plan. Let's list out simple tasks related to the theme of the hobby, that help the students apply what they have learned.

->>>>

Our lesson plan now includes practical exercises along with the other components:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Units:
{{step_3}}

Practical Exercises:
{{step_4}}

To assess the students' understanding and competency, we need to incorporate a review or assessment procedure for {{lesson_theme}}. This can be an interactive question-answer session, individual project presentations, or simple quizzes.

->>>>

The components of our lesson plan include an interactive review process:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Units:
{{step_3}}

Practical Exercises:
{{step_4}}

Review Process:
{{step_5}}

Now let's write a conclusion that summarizes the lesson, reiterating the key points learned, and the skills developed during the course of {{lesson_theme}}.

->>>>

Our lesson plan is nearing completion. We've included a comprehensive conclusion together with the other components:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Units:
{{step_3}}

Practical Exercises:
{{step_4}}

Review Process:
{{step_5}}

Conclusion:
{{step_6}}

To gather student responses, a feedback mechanism where students can share their thoughts about the lesson is essential. Time to draft one for {{lesson_theme}}.
