Your task is to write a "Bug Report" for the "Indie Game Development" industry, specifically for a "Game Tester". 
Let's start off by creating an introduction that describes the encountered bug: {{encountered_bug}}. 
This introduction should include a brief description of what type of bug was encountered and the overall impact of the bug on gameplay.

Here's some more context about the Bug Report:
Encountered Bug: {{encountered_bug}}
Bug Severity: {{bug_severity}}
Reproduction Steps: {{reproduction_steps}}
Observed Patterns: {{observed_patterns}}
Test Environment: {{test_environment}}
Possible Causes: {{possible_causes}}

->>>>

For our "Bug Report" we have an introduction that outlines the initial details of the bug:

Bug Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Now, let's classify the bug according to its severity such as game-breaking, major, minor, or cosmetic. 
This classification: {{bug_severity}}, should be added right after the bug introduction.

->>>>

Our bug report now holds the initial description and the classification of the bug:

Bug Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Bug Severity:
{{step_2}}

Moving forward, describe the process to reproduce the bug: {{reproduction_steps}}. 
Start with the game-state before the bug occurred and describe each step that leads up to the bug.

->>>>

Our bug, categorized by severity, now has a detailed reproduction process:

Bug Severity:
{{step_2}}

Reproduction Steps:
{{step_3}}

Next, list any possible indicators or patterns observed that might be connected to the bug: {{observed_patterns}}. 
This could include certain actions or triggers that seem to cause the bug to occur, or any noticeable game-states whenever the bug appears.

->>>>

We now have reproduction steps and observed patterns for the bug we're detailing:

Reproduction Steps:
{{step_3}}

Observed Patterns:
{{step_4}}

Let's provide information about the test environment where the bug has occurred: {{test_environment}}. 
Details should include the platform, the operating system, game version, hardware specifications, and other relevant details.

->>>>

Having observed patterns, our bug report now has details about the testing environment:

Observed Patterns:
{{step_4}}

Test Environment:
{{step_5}}

Begin the conclusion by summarizing the report's findings about the bug. 
This summary should recap the {{encountered_bug}} and {{bug_severity}}, allowing the development team to quickly grasp the key points of the report.

->>>>

Having detailed the test environment, we now have a summary of the bug report:

Test Environment:
{{step_5}}

Report Summary:
{{step_6}}

End the report by proposing possible areas in the game that could be causing the bug: {{possible_causes}}. 
This could be specific game mechanics or code modules.

->>>>

Having summarized the bug report, we've highlighted possible causes of the bug:

Report Summary:
{{step_6}}

Possible Causes:
{{step_7}}

Finally, include any other comments about the bug. 
This might include feedback on how this bug can affect the player experience, or any insights on how to avoid the bug from a player's perspective. 
Keep it brief and focused on the {{encountered_bug}}.
