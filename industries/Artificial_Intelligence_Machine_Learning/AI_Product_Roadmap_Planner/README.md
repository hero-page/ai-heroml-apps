# AI Product Roadmap Planner

AI Product Roadmap Planner, a strategic AI product development planner transforms the complex process of product development in the AI industry into a streamlined workflow. Users can specify variables in prompts, while the app generates custom, comprehensive, high-quality content outlining the product's goal, development timeline, needed resources, key technology features, possible challenges, and a summation. Uniquely, this roadmap is not a mere description but an insightful guide for development teams and an effective communication tool for stakeholders. Elevating organization and strategic approach in the AI field has never been easier.

## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./ai_product_roadmap_planner.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./ai_product_roadmap_planner.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./ai_product_roadmap_planner.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./ai_product_roadmap_planner.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./ai_product_roadmap_planner.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for AI Product Roadmap Planner
```
Let's create a product roadmap for a Product Manager within the Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Industry, focusing on your product: {{product_name}}. The first step is to craft a concise introduction that outlines the objective of your product: {{product_objective}}. 

Here's some more context about the Product Roadmap:
Product Objective: {{product_objective}}
Development Milestones: {{development_milestones}}
Required Resources: {{required_resources}}
Key Technologies: {{key_technologies}}
Potential Challenges: {{potential_challenges}}

->>>>

The introduction for the product roadmap of {{product_name}} is ready:

Product Objective:
{{step_1}}

Now, let's outline a timeline for the development of {{product_name}}, marking key features or development milestones such as research and development, prototyping, alpha and beta testing, and product release.

->>>>

Our {{product_name}} product roadmap has an objective:

Product Objective:
{{step_1}}

And it includes a detailed timeline for development:

Development Timeline:
{{step_2}}

For the next, let's discuss the resources required for each of these milestones in the product's lifecycle. These could include personnel, equipment, or facilities.

->>>>

Now, we have detailed the necessary resources for {{product_name}}'s development:

Product Objective:
{{step_1}}

Development Timeline:
{{step_2}}

Required Resources:
{{step_3}}

The next step in our roadmap is to map out the key technological aspects that {{product_name}} will contain. In regard to AI and ML, specify which algorithms or models will be used, whether they'll be developed in-house or sourced externally, and any other technologically relevant components of the product.

->>>>

Our roadmap for {{product_name}} includes:

Product Objective:
{{step_1}}

Development Timeline:
{{step_2}}

Required Resources:
{{step_3}}

Additionally, we have outlined the key technologies:

Key Technologies:
{{step_4}}

Let's now discuss the potential major risks and roadblocks that could occur during the development or post-launch of {{product_name}}. These might include things such as regulatory challenges to technological hurdles.
