Your task is to write a "Zoning Proposal" for the "Local Government Administration" industry, specifically for a "City Planner". 
Let's begin with an introduction that outlines the general premise of the zoning proposal: {{proposal_overview}}. This introduction should explain the proposed land use in the identified zone.

Here's some more context about the Zoning Proposal:
Proposal Overview: {{proposal_overview}}
Zone Boundaries: {{zone_boundaries}}
Proposal Rationale: {{proposal_rationale}}
Current Zone Status: {{current_zone_status}}
Proposed Land Use: {{proposed_land_use}}
Community Benefits: {{community_benefits}}
Impact Assessment: {{impact_assessment}}
Process And Timeline: {{process_and_timeline}}

We have the introduction to our zoning proposal:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, detail the geographical boundaries of the proposed area: {{zone_boundaries}}. Indicate the precise geographic location and its corresponding identifying parameters.

We have stated the community benefits and conducted an impact assessment for our zoning proposal:

Community Benefits:
{{step_6}}

Impact Assessment:
{{step_7}}

Next, propose a timeline and progression for the rezone application, public hearings, plan amendment, and actual implementation: {{process_and_timeline}}. This will offer stakeholders a clear idea of when and how the proposal will progress.
