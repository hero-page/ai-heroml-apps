Let's begin by addressing the task of creating a Reflexology Session Guide for a Reflexologist in the Acupressure & Reflexology industry. The first step is to generate an introduction that provides an overview of the reflexology session, its aims, and its expected outcomes. Remember to tailor this overview to your specific session goals.

Here's some more context about the Reflexology Session Guide:
Session Goals: {{session_goals}}
Reflex Points: {{reflex_points}}
Preparation Process: {{preparation_process}}
Post Session Care: {{post_session_care}}
Client Specific Variables: {{client_specific_variables}}

Now that we have a foundation to work with:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

The second step is to describe in detail the anatomy of feet and hands relevant to reflexology points. Identify how each reflex point corresponds to a specific organ, gland, or function of the body. Again, ensure this description aligns with your session goals.

The third step is to outline a systematic process for preparing the client before a session. This could include pre-assessments, environment setup, and comfort considerations.

The fourth step will be to detail a clear, step-by-step technique for the reflexology session. This guide should start from the initial relaxation techniques and continue through manipulating various reflex points, concluding with calming techniques to end the session.
