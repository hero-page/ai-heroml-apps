Your task is to write a "Budget Summary" for the "Grant Writing - Cultural Organizations" industry, specifically for a "Grant Writer". Let's begin with the Introduction, where we give a brief overview explaining what the "Budget Summary" contains, introducing the request for funds from the grant-awarding body. Use {{organization_name}} and {{grant_body}} for specificity.

Here's some more context about the Budget Summary:
Organization Name: {{organization_name}}
Grant Body: {{grant_body}}
Cultural Initiatives: {{cultural_initiatives}}
Expenses Categories: {{expenses_categories}}
Other Funding Sources: {{other_funding_sources}}
Sustainability Plan: {{sustainability_plan}}

For the "Budget Summary", we have an introduction:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, let's present the purpose or necessity of the grant for {{organization_name}}. Highlight the specific cultural projects, events, or programs for which funding is needed, and justify why this is necessary and valuable for the community. Describe these initiatives using the {{cultural_initiatives}} dynamic variable.

Now, we need to give a detailed itemized account of how the funds will be used. We'll separate it into categories such as salaries, equipment, facility maintenance, etc., based on {{expenses_categories}}. Be sure to include specifics about the costs of each proposed expenditure.

Next, let's discuss other sources of funding apart from the grant for which the "Budget Summary" is being prepared. These might include individual donations, membership dues, ticket sales etc. - falling under {{other_funding_sources}}. A detailed disclosure will provide a complete picture of the financial situation of {{organization_name}}.
