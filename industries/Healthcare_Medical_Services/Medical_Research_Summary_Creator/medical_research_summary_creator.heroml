Your task is to write a "Research Summary" for the "Healthcare & Medical Services" industry for a "Medical Researcher". 
Let's start by drafting a concise and comprehensive abstract for the research topic: {{research_topic}}. The abstract should overview the significance of the research and its key findings, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.

Here's some more context about the Research Summary:
Research Topic: {{research_topic}}
Background Information: {{background_information}}
Research Methods: {{research_methods}}
Key Findings: {{key_findings}}
Implications: {{implications}}

->>>>

We've created an abstract for our "Research Summary":

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Next, let's create a detailed introduction that expands on the background information: {{background_information}}. This should provide the research context, define the research problem, and emphasize its significance in the healthcare and medical field.

->>>>

Now, we have the introduction for the "Research Summary":

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Moving forward, let's detail the research methods: {{research_methods}} used in the study. Remember to include all the key steps of the methodology, highlighting ethical considerations, experimental design, participant demographics, data collection techniques, and data analysis processes.

->>>>

In our "Research Summary", we now have the introduction and the research methods:

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Research Methods:
{{step_3}}

Next, reveal the key findings: {{key_findings}} of the research, connecting these outcomes back to the problem outlined in the introduction.

->>>>

So far in the "Research Summary", we have the research methods and the key findings:

Research Methods:
{{step_3}}

Key Findings:
{{step_4}}

Let's describe the implications of this research: {{implications}}. It's crucial to explain the potential impact of these results on advancing knowledge in the medical field and contributing to improved healthcare services.

->>>>

For our "Research Summary", we now have detailed descriptions of key findings and their implications:

Key Findings:
{{step_4}}

Implications:
{{step_5}}

To wrap up our research summary, let's compose a conclusion that revisits the research topic: {{research_topic}}, summarizes the key findings along with their implications, and suggests areas for further investigation.

->>>>

We've reached the end of the "Research Summary", containing:

Implications:
{{step_5}}

Conclusion:
{{step_6}}

For the optional section, let's compile a list of references that were used throughout the summary. Ensure to follow either the APA or MLA format, according to your preference.
