Your task is to write a "Configuration Guide" for the "IT Infrastructure Documentation" industry, specifically for a "Network Engineer".

To initiate this task, start by generating an introduction that explains the purpose of this guide and offers an overview of its scope concerning the network setup: {{network_setup}}.

Here's some more context about the Configuration Guide:
Network Setup: {{network_setup}}
Technology Stack: {{technology_stack}}

->>>>

We have begun our "Configuration Guide" with an introductory section:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, provide a comprehensive background of the technology stack involved in the network setup: {{technology_stack}}.
