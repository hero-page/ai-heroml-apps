Your task is to write a "Long-Term Funding Strategy" for the "Grant Writing - Animal Welfare" industry, specifically for a "Shelter Manager". Let's start by introducing the document. This introduction should address the purpose and intent of the document and specify the objective: {{funding_objective}}, in clear, concise terms.

Here's some more context about the Long-Term Funding Strategy:
Funding Objective: {{funding_objective}}
Current Funding: {{current_funding}}
Future Costs: {{future_costs}}
Potential Funding Sources: {{potential_funding_sources}}
Strategy To Gain Funding: {{strategy_to_gain_funding}}
Potential Obstacles: {{potential_obstacles}}

We now have the introduction of our "Long-Term Funding Strategy":

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Let's progress by reviewing and detailing the current state of your animal shelter's funding. This section should outline the source of present funds: {{current_funding}} and describe your current financial situation.

Current Funding State:
{{step_2}}

Next, identify and enumerate future needs. Discuss expected future costs: {{future_costs}} involved in the running and improvement of the shelter, remembering to factor in growth and inflation.

In our "Long-Term Funding Strategy", we've detailed our introduction, current funding state, and future needs:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Current Funding State:
{{step_2}}

Future Needs:
{{step_3}}

Next, create a section for potential funding sources. This should include information about both current funders who can provide more funding, new funders and additional revenue streams: {{potential_funding_sources}}.

The "Long-Term Funding Strategy" now consists of an introduction, current funding state, future needs, and potential funding sources:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Current Funding State:
{{step_2}}

Future Needs:
{{step_3}}

Potential Funding Sources:
{{step_4}}

Consolidating these points, develop a section that strategizes how you will approach these potential funders. Convey the importance of their donations using specific examples of how their funding will help like: {{strategy_to_gain_funding}}.

Our "Long-Term Funding Strategy" includes an introduction, an overview on the current and future funding state, potential funding sources, and a strategy to approach these sources:

Introduction:

Current Funding State:
{{step_2}}

Future Needs:
{{step_3}}

Potential Funding Sources:
{{step_4}}

Strategy to Gain Funding:
{{step_5}}

Next, brainstorm and discuss possible challenges and map out a contingency plan in case of unsuccessful funding rounds. Define potential obstacles: {{potential_obstacles}} and generate strategies to counter them.
