Your task is to write a "World Building Guide" for a "Dungeon Master" in the "Board Games & Tabletop RPGs" industry. 

Let's start with an introduction that summarizes the purpose of the guide and sketches out the basic parameters of the world to be built: {{world_concept}}.

Geography Climate: {{geography_climate}}
Races Species: {{races_species}}

For the next step, define the system of magic or supernatural phenomena, if any, present in the world: {{world_magic}}. Describe how it works, who can use it, and how it impacts the world and the people living there.

Finally, summarize the guide with an overview of adventuring in the world. Discuss potential plot hooks, dungeons, conflicts, and important NPCs. 

For each of these paragraphs, keep in mind how each element can impact the gameplay, storyline and choices players might make, and highlight elements that make the world unique to enhance its vividness and appeal.
