## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./auto_repair_estimate_detailer.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./auto_repair_estimate_detailer.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./auto_repair_estimate_detailer.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./auto_repair_estimate_detailer.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./auto_repair_estimate_detailer.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Auto Repair Estimate Detailer
```
Your task is to write a "Repair Estimate" for the "Automotive Sales & Services" industry, specifically for an "Automotive Technician". Let's start with an introduction by greeting the vehicle owner and providing details about the vehicle (e.g., year, make, model, mileage) {{vehicle_info}}. Also detail the reason for the estimate: {{estimate_reason}}.

Here's some more context about the Repair Estimate:
Estimate Reason: {{estimate_reason}}
Vehicle Info: {{vehicle_info}}
Initial Condition: {{initial_condition}}
Inspection Findings: {{inspection_findings}}
Proposed Services: {{proposed_services}}
Service Costs: {{service_costs}}
Service Duration: {{service_duration}}

->>>>

We have an introduction for our repair estimate:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, we need to detail our inspection findings. Start by describing the initial condition of the vehicle upon drop-off, noting any visible issues: {{initial_condition}}. Then, present the results from your vehicle inspection, describing the discovered problems and what might have caused them: {{inspection_findings}}.

->>>>

We have conducted our inspection and detailed the findings as follows:

Inspection Findings:
{{step_2}}

Now, based on the findings, let's propose the necessary repairs and replacements: {{proposed_services}}. Describe why these services are necessary for each issue found.

->>>>

Our inspection was detailed in:

Inspection Findings:
{{step_2}}

Now, we have proposed the necessary repairs and replacements and explained why they are necessary:

Proposed Repairs and Replacements:
{{step_3}}

Next, provide a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each proposed service, including parts, labor, and any other applicable fees: {{service_costs}}. Sum up with the total cost for all proposed services.

->>>>

Our proposed repairs and replacements are given in:

Proposed Repairs and Replacements:
{{step_3}}

Here is the detailed cost breakdown for each proposed service and the total cost:

Estimate Costs:
{{step_4}}

Now, estimate how long each repair or maintenance process will take: {{service_duration}}. Also provide details about when the vehicle will be ready for pickup.

->>>>

After giving a detailed cost estimation in:

Estimate Costs:
{{step_4}}

We have now provided an estimated duration for each service and the expected vehicle pick-up time:

Timeline and Logistics:
{{step_5}}

Let's conclude our repair estimate by giving the contact information of the technician or service department, so that the vehicle owner can follow-up their questions or concerns.
