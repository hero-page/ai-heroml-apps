To generate a "Data Analysis Report" in the "Academic & University" industry for a "Researcher", follow the steps outlined below:

Starting, let's write an informative abstract that provides an overview of the data analysis report, including the research problem, methodologies, major findings, and implications. 

Here's some more context about the Data Analysis Report:
Abstract Overview: {{abstract_overview}}
Research Problem: {{research_problem}}
Literature Review: {{literature_review}}
Methodology: {{methodology}}
Data Findings: {{data_findings}}
Discussion Points: {{discussion_points}}
Conclusion Points: {{conclusion_points}}
Reference List: {{reference_list}}

->>>>

We have begun our Data Analysis Report with:

Abstract Overview:
{{step_1}}

Moving forward, let's develop an introduction that defines the research problem, explains its importance, and states the objectives of the research.

->>>>

We have crafted an Introduction for our Data Analysis Report that builds on the abstract:

Abstract Overview:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

We need to incorporate a literature review section next. This section should summarize previous research studies related to your topic, providing context for our own research and emphasizing the need for our study.

->>>>

We now have an Introduction and a Literature review for our Data Analysis Report:

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

Let's proceed with the methodology section that clearly outlines the procedures used in the research process, including data collection and analysis methods.

->>>>

Our Data Analysis Report now includes an Introduction, Literature review, and Methodology:

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Literature Review:
{{step_3}}

Methodology:
{{step_4}}

In the results section, we should present the outcomes of our data analysis. Let's generate this section by summarizing the findings without interpretation.

->>>>

Our Data Analysis Report now includes the Results as well:

Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Results:
{{step_5}}

The next section is the Discussion, where we shall interpret the results, compare them with previous studies, and discuss implications for future research.

->>>>

Our Data Analysis Report now includes the Discussion derived from our Results:

Results:
{{step_5}}

Discussion:
{{step_6}}

We should now proceed to the conclusion of the report. Let's put together a conclusion that summarizes the main points of the research, data analysis, the implications of findings, and identifies opportunities for future research.

->>>>

Our Data Analysis Report now includes the Conclusion:

Discussion:
{{step_6}}

Conclusion:
{{step_7}}

To finish off, let's compile a list of references that mention all books, articles, and other resources used in the research.
