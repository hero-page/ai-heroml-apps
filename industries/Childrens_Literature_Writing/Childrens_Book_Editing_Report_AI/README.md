## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./childrens_book_editing_report_ai.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./childrens_book_editing_report_ai.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./childrens_book_editing_report_ai.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./childrens_book_editing_report_ai.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./childrens_book_editing_report_ai.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Children's Book Editing Report AI
```
Your task is to write an "Editing Report" for the "Children's Literature Writing" industry, as an "Editor". 
Begin by addressing a brief background of the manuscript, highlight the manuscript's title: {{manuscript_title}}, the author's name: {{author_name}}, and its target age group.
Also, explain the purpose of the editing report and what it hopes to achieve for the manuscript.

Here's some more context about the Editing Report:
Manuscript Title: {{manuscript_title}}
Author Name: {{author_name}}
Manuscript Overview: {{manuscript_overview}}
Needed Revisions: {{needed_revisions}}
Summary: {{summary}}

->>>>

For the editing report of the children's book:

Manuscript Title:
{{step_1}}

Next, summarize your overall impressions of the manuscript. Discuss any observed strengths and weaknesses in the narrative, character development, and language usage:{{manuscript_overview}}. 
Additionally, address the readability and engagement level of the manuscript for its intended group age.

->>>>

Now, we have the overall impression of the manuscript:

Impression:
{{step_2}}

For the next part, provide an in-depth analysis of the plot, structure, characters: {{in-depth_analysis}}. 
Assess the expositional detail, flow of story, and logic consistency specific to children's literature. 
Also, note any areas that are confusing or unclear that could be challenging for the intended reader. 
Plus, include language observations and suitability for the target audience such as use of vocabulary, sentence structure, and engagement factor.

Now, we have generated an in-depth analysis of the book:

In-depth Analysis:
{{step_3}}

Next, proceed to discuss the parts of the manuscript that need revisions or improvements: {{needed_revisions}}. 
Offer constructive and specific suggestions on how to correct and improve these areas, ensuring these observations and suggestions are made in a respectful and helpful tone.

->>>>

The editing report now includes a section of suggested revisions:

Then, share thoughts on how the manuscript fits into current children's literature trends. 
State if the manuscript is ready for submission to a publisher, or if revisions are needed before it reaches that stage. 
If applicable, present comparative titles that could guide the author in understanding their competition and potential positioning in the market.

->>>>

Now, we have generated the manuscript's marketability factors:

Marketability Factors:
{{step_5}}

To conclude the editing report, summarize the primary points raised in the report: {{summary}}. 
Finish with recommendations for the next steps, including possible deadlines for author revisions.
