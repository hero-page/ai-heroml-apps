Your task is to write a "Network Diagram" for the "IT Infrastructure Documentation" industry, specifically for a "Network Engineer". Let's start with an introductory description that summarizes the overall outlook of the network infrastructure: {{network_summary}}.

Here's some more context about the Network Diagram:
Network Summary: {{network_summary}}
Primary Devices: {{primary_devices}}
Network Zones: {{network_zones}}
Network Subnets: {{network_subnets}}
Network Interactions: {{network_interactions}}
Security Devices: {{security_devices}}
Traffic Flow: {{traffic_flow}}
Wifi Zones: {{wifi_zones}}
Network Redundancy: {{network_redundancy}}
Network Inventory: {{network_inventory}}
Revision History: {{revision_history}}

->>>>

The introductory summary of network infrastructure is complete:

Network Summary:
{{step_1}}

Now, let's develop a hierarchy representing the primary devices in your network like routers, switches, servers, and their interconnections: {{primary_devices}}.

->>>>

We have the hierarchy of primary devices and their interconnections:

Primary Devices:
{{step_2}}

Next, identify and detail the key sections or zones within the network such as data centers, connectivity trunks, access points, and user zones: {{network_zones}}.

->>>>

So far we have a detailed hierarchy of devices and the key network zones:

Key Network Zones:
{{step_3}}

Continuing, the task now is to include the representation of various network subnets, segregations, and how they interact with one another, covering their IP ranges: {{network_subnets}}.

->>>>

Good progress. We now have a detailed layout of the network subnets and segregations:

Network Subnets:
{{step_4}}

We now have to define the point of interactions between the internal network and the outside world, including firewalls, the Internet, VPN endpoints, and other external entities: {{network_interactions}}.

->>>>

Our network diagram now includes the internal and external points of interaction:

Network Interactions:
{{step_5}}

Now, let's highlight critical security elements such as intrusion detection systems or other threat management devices: {{security_devices}}.

->>>>

We have now added the critical security elements to our network diagram:

Security Elements:
{{step_6}}

We'll move on to describe the network traffic flow between devices and zones in the network, including addressing routing protocols used: {{traffic_flow}}.

->>>>

The network traffic flow has been described:

Network Traffic Flow:
{{step_7}}

Let's now incorporate Wi-Fi access points, their coverage areas, and how they are connected to the rest of the network: {{wifi_zones}}.

->>>>

Next, we have added Wi-Fi access points and their connections:

Wi-Fi Zones:
{{step_8}}

For efficiency, let's detail redundancy and failover directions e.g. secondary devices, standby systems, network links, and how they kick in when primary links fail: {{network_redundancy}}.

->>>>

At this point, redundancy and failover directions have been done:

Network Redundancy:
{{step_9}}

Let's conclude with a key section that is highly descriptive and includes all necessary information about software versions, hardware types, makes, models of the equipment: {{network_inventory}}.
