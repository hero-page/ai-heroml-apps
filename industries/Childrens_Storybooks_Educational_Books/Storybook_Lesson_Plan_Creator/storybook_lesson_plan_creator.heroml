Your task is to write a "Lesson Plan" for the "Children's Storybooks - Educational Books" industry, specifically for an "Educational Consultant". 

Let's start by providing a broad overview of the lesson plan. The first section should help the educational consultant understand the overall aim of the lesson. Here, introduce and define the main topic: {{main_topic}}, the age group of children it is designed for: {{target_age_group}}, and the learning objectives: {{learning_objectives}}.

Here's some more context about the Lesson Plan:
Main Topic: {{main_topic}}
Target Age Group: {{target_age_group}}
Learning Objectives: {{learning_objectives}}
Teaching Methods: {{teaching_methods}}
Assessment Method: {{assessment_method}}

We have created an initial overview of our lesson plan:

Next, let's proceed to describe the pedagogical model. Explain the methodologies and strategies that you intend to use to achieve the learning objectives: {{teaching_methods}}. Be sure to include a variety of teaching methods to cater to children's different learning styles and to make the sessions engaging.

Moving on, we need to outline the specific lesson details in a sequential manner. Start from the introduction of the topic, then the core lesson and finally, the conclusion. Each lesson detail should progress in a way that aids comprehension and retention of knowledge. For each lesson detail, provide a description of the activity, and the associated learning objective.
