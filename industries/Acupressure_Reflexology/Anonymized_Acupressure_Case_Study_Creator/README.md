## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./anonymized_acupressure_case_study_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./anonymized_acupressure_case_study_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./anonymized_acupressure_case_study_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./anonymized_acupressure_case_study_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./anonymized_acupressure_case_study_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Anonymized Acupressure Case Study Creator
```
Your task is to write a "Client Anonymized Case Study" for an "Acupressure Practitioner". Begin with a brief about the client's issue, remembering to anonymize all personal client information. You can use pseudonyms or general terms to avoid revealing client information.

Here's some more context about the Client Anonymized Case Study:
Client Issue: {{client_issue}}
Initial Health Status: {{initial_health_status}}
Previous Treatments: {{previous_treatments}}
Action Plan: {{Action_plan}}
Number Of Sessions: {{number_of_sessions}}
Improvements Noted: {{improvements_noted}}
Post Treatment Health Status: {{post_treatment_health_status}}
Client Feedback: {{client_feedback}}

->>>>

Now we have a brief description about the client's issue:

Introduction and issue:
{{step_1}}

In the next step, elaborate on the initial health status of the client and severity of the problem, using information such as {{initial_health_status}}, {{Length_of_time_suffering}}, and {{previous_treatments}}.

->>>>

Having defined the client's initial situation:

Introduction and issue:
{{step_1}}

Client's initial status:
{{step_2}}

Next, provide a detailed account of the acupressure treatment process including the action plan developed ({{Action_plan}}). Discuss the acupressure points targeted, why they were chosen, and provide details of the duration and frequency of the treatment.

->>>>

The beginning of a case study and the treatment process has been detailed as:

Introduction and issue:
{{step_1}}

Client's initial status:
{{step_2}}

Treatment process:
{{step_3}}

In this next step, focus on capturing the client's progression with the treatment using variables like {{number_of_sessions}} and {{improvements_noted}} to highlight signs of recovery or progress.

->>>>

We have captured the treatment process and client's progress as follows:

Treatment process:
{{step_3}}

Client's progression during treatment:
{{step_4}}

Now, provide details on the client's post-treatment condition. Cover changes in the client's health status after the acupressure regimen using {{post_treatment_health_status}} and include the client's feedback with {{client_feedback}}.

->>>>

So far in the case study, these are the details of the client's condition and the treatment process:

Client's progression during treatment:
{{step_4}}

Post-treatment condition and client's feedback:
{{step_5}}

Now, wrap up the case study with a conclusion summarizing the client's journey from their initial condition, through the treatment process, and the final outcome.

->>>>

The case study thus far includes the client's journey and their post-treatment condition:

Post-treatment condition and client's feedback:
{{step_5}}

Conclusion:
{{step_6}}

In the final step, we reflect on the effectiveness of the acupressure treatment, considering any further recommendations or necessary follow-ups. Ensure your writing continues to be empathetic and non-technical for readers' easy understanding.
