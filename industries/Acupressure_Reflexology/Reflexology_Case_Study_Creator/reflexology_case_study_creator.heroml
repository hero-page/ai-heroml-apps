Your task is to write a "Client Anonymized Case Study" for the "Acupressure & Reflexology" industry, specifically for a "Reflexologist". 

We start by introducing our client. Remember, we do not include any personal identification information. 
Instead, focus on their health history and lifestyle, concluding with a summary of the condition of the patient before seeking therapy: {{pre_therapy_condition}}.

Here's some more context about the Client Anonymized Case Study:
Pre Therapy Condition: {{pre_therapy_condition}}
Therapeutic Goal: {{therapeutic_goal}}
Reflexology Techniques: {{reflexology_techniques}}
Progression Account: {{progression_account}}
Post Therapy Condition: {{post_therapy_condition}}
Benefits Of Treatment: {{benefits_of_treatment}}
Key Learnings: {{key_learnings}}

With the client's background and pre-therapy condition established, let's detail the therapeutic goal set by the reflexologist, considering the client's initial condition.
