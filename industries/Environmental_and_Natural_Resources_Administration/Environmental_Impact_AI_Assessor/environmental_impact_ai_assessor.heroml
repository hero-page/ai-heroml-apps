Your task is to write an "Environmental Impact Assessment" for the "Environmental and Natural Resources Administration" industry, specifically for an "Environmental Officer". 

Start by drafting an executive summary for the project proposal: {{project_proposal}} that briefly outlines the key environmental risks and mitigation measures associated with it.

Here's some more context about the Environmental Impact Assessment:
Project Proposal: {{project_proposal}}
Project Overview: {{project_overview}}
Baseline Conditions: {{baseline_conditions}}
Project Impacts: {{project_impacts}}
Impact Evaluation: {{impact_evaluation}}
Mitigation Measures: {{mitigation_measures}}
Monitoring Plan: {{monitoring_plan}}
Stakeholder Consultation: {{stakeholder_consultation}}
Project Alternatives: {{project_alternatives}}

->>>>

We have an executive summary for the Environmental Impact Assessment:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Next, write an introduction that explains the purpose of the assessment and provides an overview of the project: {{project_overview}}.

->>>>

Our Environmental Impact Assessment now has an executive summary and an introduction:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Moving on, describe the baseline environmental conditions: {{baseline_conditions}} prior to the project commencement. These should include factors such as air and water quality, flora and fauna, socio-economic conditions, etc.

->>>>

We have an executive summary, introduction, and a description of the baseline environmental conditions:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Baseline Environmental Conditions:
{{step_3}}

Following this, identify and describe the possible environmental impacts: {{project_impacts}} of the proposed project. This should extend from the construction and operational stages to decommissioning.

->>>>

The Environmental Impact Assessment now includes the identification of possible environmental impacts:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Baseline Environmental Conditions:
{{step_3}}

Environmental Impact Identification:
{{step_4}}

Next, evaluate these impacts and rank them according to their significance: {{impact_evaluation}}.

->>>>

Our Environmental Impact Assessment now includes an evaluation of the detected environmental impacts:

Environmental Impact Identification:
{{step_4}}

Environmental Impact Evaluation:
{{step_5}}

Subsequently, describe the measures taken to avoid, reduce, or remedy the significant impacts: {{mitigation_measures}}.

->>>>

The assessment now includes a description of mitigation measures:

Environmental Impact Evaluation:
{{step_5}}

Mitigation Measures:
{{step_6}}

Up next, develop a plan for monitoring and managing these environmental impacts during the implementation of the project: {{monitoring_plan}}.

->>>>

The Environmental Impact Assessment now includes a mitigation plan and a project monitoring plan:

Mitigation Measures:
{{step_6}}

Project Monitoring Plan:
{{step_7}}

Following this, illustrate the process and results of consultation with affected groups and stakeholders: {{stakeholder_consultation}}. Document their views, concerns and how these have been acknowledged or addressed in the assessment.

->>>>

Now our Environmental Impact Assessment includes a record of stakeholder consultation:

Project Monitoring Plan:
{{step_7}}

Stakeholder Consultation:
{{step_8}}

Next, identify and describe any alternatives to the project that could reduce environmental harm: {{project_alternatives}}. Also, explain why the proposed project is chosen over these alternatives.

->>>>

The Environmental Impact Assessment now outlines project alternatives:

Stakeholder Consultation:
{{step_8}}

Project Alternatives:
{{step_9}}

Lastly, round off the assessment with a non-technical summary repeating the key points of the assessment - the potential environmental impacts, the proposed mitigation measures, and the monitoring plan.
