## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./astrological_transit_guidance_generator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./astrological_transit_guidance_generator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./astrological_transit_guidance_generator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./astrological_transit_guidance_generator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./astrological_transit_guidance_generator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Astrological Transit Guidance Generator

Your task is to write a "Planetary Transit Explanation" for the "Astrology & Esoteric Services" industry, specifically for an "Astrologer". 

To begin, create an introduction that defines planetary transit and explains its importance in astrology.

Here's some more context about the Planetary Transit Explanation:
Planetary Transit: {{planetary_transit}}
Current Transit: {{current_transit}}
General Implications: {{general_implications}}
Zodiac Signs: {{zodiac_signs}}

Our journey into planetary transits has started with a clear understanding of what they are:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Now, generate an overview of the current planetary transit(s) happening at this moment. This should include which planet is involved, the sign it's transiting through, and the duration of the transit.

Our explanation of planetary transits for an astrologer so far consists of the following parts:

Next, discuss the general astrological implications of the current transit. This might include areas of life typically influenced by the involved planet, traits associated with the sign the planet is transiting through, and the symbolic or spiritual significance related to the transit.

The explanation of planetary transits for an astrologer we are creating has the following components:

Now, delve into a detailed interpretation of what the current planetary transit might signify for each zodiac sign. You may want to address how individuals with different sun signs, moon signs, rising signs or prominent placements in their natal charts might be affected.

Interpretation for Each Zodiac Sign:
{{step_4}}

Next, provide guidance and suggestions drawn from your astrological analysis. For instance, during the transit phase of the current transit in question, what actions should someone take? What aspects of life should they pay specific attention to?

Our "Planetary Transit Explanation" has these sections in place so far:

Our final action is to close the explanation with a concise summary of the content, re-emphasizing the main points, and ensure to encourage the audience to view the transit(s) as opportunities for growth and transformation, and to note that these are general interpretations - personal experiences might vary based on individual natal charts.
