## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./lab_equipment_manual_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./lab_equipment_manual_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./lab_equipment_manual_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./lab_equipment_manual_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./lab_equipment_manual_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Lab Equipment Manual Creator
```
Your task is to write an "Equipment Operation Manual" for the "Academic & University" industry, specifically for a "Lab Technician". 

Let's begin with an introduction that explains what the equipment does. Describe the equipment: {{equipment_description}}.

Here's some more context about the Equipment Operation Manual:
Equipment Description: {{equipment_description}}
Purpose And Audience: {{purpose_and_audience}}
Safety Measures: {{safety_measures}}
Operation Steps: {{operation_steps}}
Troubleshooting Tips: {{troubleshooting_tips}}
Maintenance Procedures: {{maintenance_procedures}}
Technical Glossary: {{technical_glossary}}
Additional Resources: {{additional_resources}}

->>>>

The following is a brief description of the equipment:

Equipment Description:
{{step_1}}

Now, write a brief about what this manual is intended for and whom it benefits: {{purpose_and_audience}}.

->>>>

We have our Equipment Description:

Equipment Description:
{{step_1}}

And a brief regarding the purpose of this manual and its audience:

Purpose and Audience:
{{step_2}}

Next, provide a safety caution section that details the measures to be followed while handling the equipment.

->>>>

Our Equipment Operation Manual currently comprises:

Purpose and Audience:
{{step_2}}

Safety Measures:
{{step_3}}

Now, we need a usage guide that presents step-by-step instructions on how to operate the equipment.

->>>>

So far in our Equipment Operation Manual, we have:

Safety Measures:
{{step_3}}

Operation Steps (Usage Guide):
{{step_4}}

The next section should be troubleshooting tips that outline common issues technicians may encounter with the equipment, and how to solve them.

->>>>

To date, our Equipment Operation Manual features:

Operation Steps:
{{step_4}}

Troubleshooting Tips:
{{step_5}}

Next, create a guide on the periodic maintenance procedures to help prolong the lifespan of the equipment.

->>>>

Our Equipment Operation Manual, for lab technicians, includes:

Troubleshooting Tips:
{{step_5}}

Maintenance Procedures:
{{step_6}}

The manual should also include a glossary that explains technical terms related to the equipment present throughout the manual.

->>>>

Let's look at what we have so far for our Equipment Operation Manual:

Maintenance Procedures:
{{step_6}}

Technical Glossary:
{{step_7}}

Proceed to write a conclusion emphasizing the importance of adhering to the instructions and safety measures stated in the manual when handling the equipment.

->>>>

Our medical equipment operation manual designed for lab technicians includes:

Technical Glossary:
{{step_7}}

Conclusion:
{{step_8}}

Finally, append an additional resources section providing information on where to find replacement parts, technical support, or further information about the equipment.
