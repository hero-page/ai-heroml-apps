Start by writing an executive summary for the "Project Implementation Plan" in the "Grant Writing - International Development" sector:

Here's some more context about the Project Implementation Plan:
Project Overview: {{project_overview}}
Problem Description: {{problem_description}}
Project Objectives: {{project_objectives}}
Project Phases: {{project_phases}}
Team Responsibilities: {{team_responsibilities}}
Potential Risks: {{potential_risks}}
Measuring Progress: {{measuring_progress}}

->>>>

Now, we have an executive summary for the project:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Next, provide context and justification for the project. This will explain the problem the project aims to address, using data and real-world examples where relevant.

->>>>

Our project has an executive summary and a context and justification section:
