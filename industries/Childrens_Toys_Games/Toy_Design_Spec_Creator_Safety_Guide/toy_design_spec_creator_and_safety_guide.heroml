Your task is to write a "Design Specification" for the "Children's Toys & Games" industry, specifically for a "Toy Designer". Let's start by introducing the conceived toy concept: {{toy_concept}}. This concept should summarize the overall vision of the toy/game and the specific media or type of play it pertains to, such as traditional games, electronic toys, or outdoor play gear.

Here's some more context about the Design Specification:
Toy Concept: {{toy_concept}}
Toy Objective: {{toy_objective}}
Age Group: {{age_group}}
Toy Features: {{toy_features}}
Play Method: {{play_method}}
Packaging Presentation: {{packaging_presentation}}

Now, we have the conceived toy concept:

Toy Concept:
{{step_1}}

Next, outline the primary objective of the toy: {{toy_objective}}. Here you will articulate the key benefits the toy should offer to its user, like enhancing creativity, promoting physical activity, or developing certain skills.

For our toy design, we have specified the concept:

Toy Concept:
{{step_1}}

We also have the primary objective of the toy:

Toy Objective:
{{step_2}}

Now, specify the toy's intended age group: {{age_group}}. Clearly communicate the suitable age range for the toy, ensuring the features and complexity of the toy align with the cognitive level and safety requirements of the specified age group.

Toy Objective:
{{step_2}}

Now, we have defined the toy's intended age group:

Age Group:
{{step_3}}

Next, delve into a comprehensive description of the toy's design features and functions: {{toy_features}}. This part should elucidate the core elements of the toy, particularly its look, form, materials, working mechanism, and interactive elements, all in a manner that complies with safety norms for the mentioned age group.

Now, we also have an elaborate description of the toy's design features and functions:

Toy's Design Features and Functions:
{{step_4}}

Moving on, describe the method and process of play: {{play_method}}. Explain how a child is intended to interact with and use the toy/game for fun and to achieve the stated toy objective.

Design Features and Functions:
{{step_4}}

We also defined how a child is meant to play with the toy:

Method and Process of Play:
{{step_5}}

Now, approach the packaging and presentation: {{packaging_presentation}}. Outline the considerations for packaging such as design, unboxing experience, instructions manual, safety warnings, etc. Also articulate how the product will be presented in marketing or point of sale scenarios.
