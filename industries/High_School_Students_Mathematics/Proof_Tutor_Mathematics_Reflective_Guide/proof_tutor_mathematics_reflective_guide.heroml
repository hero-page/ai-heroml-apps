Your task is to create a "Mathematical Proof" in the "High School Students – Mathematics" industry for a "Student". 
Let's start by creating a "Statement of Problem". This is where we present the problem we are trying to prove: {{math_problem}}.

Here's some more context about the Mathematical Proof:
Math Problem: {{math_problem}}
Principal Terms: {{principal_terms}}
Assumption List: {{assumption_list}}
Verification Method: {{verification_method}}
Extended Problems: {{extended_problems}}

->>>>

We have the statement of our mathematical problem:

Statement of Problem:
{{step_1}}

Now let's continue to the "Definition of Terms" section. Here, let's define the main mathematical terms and principles applied in the problem, {{principal_terms}}, and if applicable, explain the relational dynamics between these terms.

->>>>

We have defined the terms and principles of our mathematical problem:

Definition of Terms:
{{step_2}}

Next, let's propose a “Hypothesis”. This is a tentative explanation or presumption that the {{math_problem}} is true, to be tested in our forthcoming proof.

->>>>

Our mathematical problem and its defined terms are:

Statement of Problem:
{{step_1}}

Definition of Terms:
{{step_2}}

We have formed a hypothesis for our problem:

Hypothesis:
{{step_3}}

Let's now proceed to the "Mathematical Proof" section, starting with the "Assumptions." We need to make a list of any assumptions or givens necessary for the problem: {{assumption_list}}.

->>>>

Our mathematical problem, defined terms, and hypothesis are:

Statement of Problem:
{{step_1}}

Definition of Terms:
{{step_2}}

Hypothesis:
{{step_3}}

This is the list of assumptions we've made for our problem:

Assumptions:
{{step_4}}

Next, let's develop the "Proof". We will systematically approach {{math_problem}}, showing step-by-step how it can be solved using the assumptions and principles from the previous step.

->>>>

We have assumptions and a proof procedure for our mathematical problem:

Assumptions:
{{step_4}}

Proof:
{{step_5}}

For making sure our proof is correct, proceed with the "Verification." Let's validate our proof: {{verification_method}}.

->>>>

We have the proof and its validation for our problem:

Proof:
{{step_5}}

Verification:
{{step_6}}

Let's create a "Conclusion". This is where we confirm whether the original hypothesis for the problem was proven correct, or if it was incorrect and a new hypothesis needs to be formed.

->>>>

Our mathematical problem's proof and its verification are as follows:

Proof:
{{step_5}}

Verification:
{{step_6}}

We have a conclusion based on the proof and its verification:

Conclusion:
{{step_7}}

Under the final step "Reflection," let's note what lessons were learned from this process. The reflection could incorporate discoveries about the problem, the proof process, or the mathematical principles involved.

->>>>

After concluding our mathematical problem, the lessons learned are:

Conclusion:
{{step_7}}

Reflection:
{{step_8}}

In the end, let's encourage revisiting "Extended Problems". We need to analyze and solve more complex problems: {{extended_problems}} that are based on the knowledge acquired from solving the {{math_problem}}.
