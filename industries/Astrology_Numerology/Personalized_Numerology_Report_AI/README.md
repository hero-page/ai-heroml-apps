## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./personalized_numerology_report_ai.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./personalized_numerology_report_ai.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./personalized_numerology_report_ai.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./personalized_numerology_report_ai.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./personalized_numerology_report_ai.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Personalized Numerology Report AI
```
Your task is to write a "Numerology Report" for the "Astrology & Numerology" industry, specifically for a "Numerologist". 
Let's start by creating a personalized introduction for the subject named: {{subject_name}}. This introduction should include basic information like their date of birth and relevant numerological constants derived from this data.

Here's some more context about the Numerology Report:
Subject Name: {{subject_name}}

->>>>

We now have a personalized introduction addressing the subject of the report:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, focus on the 'Life Path Number'. Start by explaining the method of calculation and its significance, then present the calculated 'Life Path Number' for {{subject_name}}. Provide an elaborate interpretation about what this number signifies in their life.

->>>>

We have an introduction and the elaboration on 'Life Path Number':
 
Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Life Path Number:
{{step_2}}

Moving onto the 'Expression Number' section, explain how the full name of {{subject_name}} translates into numerical format and how to calculate the 'Expression Number'. Discuss the impact this number has on {{subject_name}}'s talents, abilities, and shortcomings.

->>>>

In the report, the introduction, 'Life Path Number', and 'Expression Number' are as follows:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Life Path Number:
{{step_2}}

Expression Number:
{{step_3}}

Next, dedicate a section to the 'Soul Urge Number'. Like the previous parts, explain the method of calculation. Then interpret the implications of the 'Soul Urge Number' for {{subject_name}}, providing insights into their inner desires and hidden aspects of personality.

->>>>

So far, we have the elements:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Life Path Number:
{{step_2}}

Expression Number:
{{step_3}}

Soul Urge Number:
{{step_4}}

Now, let's analyze the 'Personality Number' which describes how {{subject_name}} is perceived by the world. Discuss this number in detail and interpret its significance in relation to {{subject_name}}'s external image.

->>>>

In the numerology report, we have generated:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Life Path Number:
{{step_2}}

Expression Number:
{{step_3}}

Soul Urge Number:
{{step_4}}

Personality Number:
