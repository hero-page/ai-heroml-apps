Starting the process to write an "Ad Copy" for the "E-commerce Businesses" industry, specifically for a "Digital Marketer". 

First, let's create an attention-grabbing headline that emotionally resonates with your target audience.

Here's some more context about the Ad Copy:
Headline: {{headline}}
USP: {{USP}}
Product Features Benefits: {{product_features_benefits}}
Testimonial Or Case Study: {{testimonial_or_case_study}}
Call To Action: {{call_to_action}}
Dynamic Variable: {{dynamic_variable}}

After creating the headline for the ad:

Ad Headline: 
{{step_1}}

Now, let's write a compelling introduction that communicates the unique selling proposition (USP) of your product/service.

->>>>

With an attention-grabbing headline and a compelling USP, the ad would look like:

Ad Headline:
{{step_1}}

USP:
{{step_2}}

Next, let's describe the key features and benefits of your product/service. Make sure your benefits address the pain points of your target audience.

Below is how our ad looks now with a headline, USP, and detailed product benefits:

Moving on, if available, let's include testimonies or case studies to boost credibility and trust. This allows prospective customers to see the value of your product/service.

To follow the AIDA model (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) for a well-structured ad copy, let's now create a call to action post to invite the audience to make a purchase or engage with the product/service.

->>>>

Finally, the ad, now complete with a headline, USP, product benefits, testimonials, and a call to action, reads as follows:

Ad Headline:
{{step_1}}

USP:
{{step_2}}

Key Product Features & Benefits:
{{step_3}}

Testimonials or Case Study:
{{step_4}}

Call to Action:
{{step_5}} 

Next, let's add in keywords relevant to the E-commerce industry and the Digital Marketer's specific product/service.

Ad Headline:
{{step_1}}

USP:
{{step_2}}

Key Product Features & Benefits:
{{step_3}}

Testimonials or Case Study:
{{step_4}}

Let's now move on to addressing potential objections, such as shipping times, product quality, returns and refund policy, etc.

With potential objections addressed, our ad copy looks as follows:

Ad Headline:
{{step_1}}

USP:
{{step_2}}

Key Product Features & Benefits:
{{step_3}}

Testimonials or Case Study:
{{step_4}}

Where applicable, we should include product/service scarcity or time-sensitivity to tap into the 'Fear of Missing Out' (FOMO). Let's include that.

Incorporating scarcity or time-sensitivity, our ad copy now reads:

Ad Headline:
{{step_1}}

USP:
{{step_2}}

Key Product Features & Benefits:
{{step_3}}

Testimonials or Case Study:
{{step_4}}

Call to Action:

To finalize, let's ensure FTC compliance and add any necessary disclaimers. This ensures that the ad copy isn't making unrealistic promises or falling foul of advertising regulations.
