Your task is to write a "Data Analysis Report" for the "Human Resources & Recruiting" industry, specifically for a "HR Analyst". 

Let's start by stating the Analysis Objective: {{analysis_objective}}, which includes the purpose and the scope of the analysis being reported.

Here's some more context about the Data Analysis Report:
Analysis Objective: {{analysis_objective}}
Time Period: {{time_period}}
Analysis Tools: {{analysis_tools}}
Key Trainee Variables: {{key_trainee_variables}}

->>>>

With the Analysis Objective: 

Objective:
{{step_1}}

Next, create a section for Data Collection Details. Explain the sources from which the data were collected, and detail the methodology of collection. Make sure to mention the time period of data collection: {{time_period}}.

->>>>

In our "Data Analysis Report", we have an objective and data collection details:

Objective:
{{step_1}}

Data Collection Details:
{{step_2}}

The next section covers Data Cleaning and Pre-processing. Please elucidate any errors in the data, missing values, and how they were rectified. Discuss the entire process of pre-processing the data.
