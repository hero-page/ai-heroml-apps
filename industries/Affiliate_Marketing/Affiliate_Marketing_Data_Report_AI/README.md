## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./affiliate_marketing_data_report_ai.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./affiliate_marketing_data_report_ai.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./affiliate_marketing_data_report_ai.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./affiliate_marketing_data_report_ai.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./affiliate_marketing_data_report_ai.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Affiliate Marketing Data Report AI
```
Your task is to write a "Performance Report" for the "Affiliate Marketing" industry, specifically for a "Data Analyst". 
Start by creating an executive summary that overviews the performance period, detailing necessary variables such as the campaign name: {{campaign_name}}, campaign duration: {{campaign_duration}}, main achievements, and critical points that need addressing.

Here's some more context about the Performance Report:
Campaign Name: {{campaign_name}}
Campaign Duration: {{campaign_duration}}
Campaign Goals: {{campaign_goals}}
Top Affiliates: {{top_affiliates}}

->>>>

Having prepared an executive summary for the performance report:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Next, let's introduce the background by highlighting the affiliate marketing landscape during the report period and state the specific goals of the campaign: {{campaign_goals}}.

->>>>

With a detailed executive summary and a background introduction:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Background Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Move on to present a detailed performance analysis. Here, comprehensively analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate (CVR), Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). For each KPI, detail the starting value, ending value, % change, and the reasons for these changes.

With the executive summary, background, and a detailed performance analysis:

Performance Analysis:

Next, dedicate a section detailing the performance of the top affiliate partners: {{top_affiliates}}. Explain their conversion rates, total conversions, contributed revenue, and the traffic they've driven.

With information on the executive summary, background, performance analysis, and affiliate partners:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Background Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Performance Analysis:
{{step_3}}

Affiliate Partners Overview:
{{step_4}}

An in-depth insights section should now be crafted. It should provide analysis and interpretation of the data, identifying patterns, trends, and correlations. The impacts of external factors such as changes in the competitive landscape or macroeconomic shifts should also be discussed.

->>>>

Now having insights based on the data analysis and affiliate partner overview:

Performance Analysis:
{{step_3}}

Affiliate Partners Overview:
{{step_4}}

In-depth Insights:
{{step_5}}

The next step is to come up with an action plan that proposes next steps based on the data and insights gathered. The proposed actions should aim to improve performance for the following periods and should directly relate to the initial campaign goals: {{campaign_goals}}.
