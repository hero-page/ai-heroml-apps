# Blockchain Code Documentation Creator

Blockchain Code Documentation Creator is an AI-powered tool designed for blockchain developers. It lets users specify variables to generate custom, high-quality code documentations, providing an in-depth understanding of your blockchain project. From project overview and architecture to smart contracts and security measures, the AI captures it all. The content is developer-focused, ensuring you get tailored, detailed insights specific to your coding needs, right down to the release notes.

## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./blockchain_code_documentation_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./blockchain_code_documentation_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./blockchain_code_documentation_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./blockchain_code_documentation_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./blockchain_code_documentation_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Blockchain Code Documentation Creator
```
Your task is to write a "Code Documentation" for the "Blockchain & Cryptocurrency" industry, specifically for a "Blockchain Developer". 

Start with an introduction that describes the purpose and the overall functionality of your blockchain project: {{blockchain_functionality}}.

Here's some more context about the Code Documentation:
Blockchain Functionality: {{blockchain_functionality}}
Blockchain Architecture: {{blockchain_architecture}}
Smart Contracts: {{smart_contracts}}
Consensus Mechanism: {{consensus_mechanism}}
Transaction Processing: {{transaction_processing}}
Blockchain Security: {{blockchain_security}}
Technical Appendices: {{technical_appendices}}
Release Notes: {{release_notes}}

->>>>

Our "Code Documentation" begins with an introduction on our blockchain project:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Now, outline the architecture of the blockchain solution and discuss how various components interact with each other: {{blockchain_architecture}}.

->>>>

In our "Code Documentation", we've discussed the project's introduction and its architectural details:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Next, detail the smart contracts used in the project. For each contract, provide its purpose, functions, and interactions with other contracts: {{smart_contracts}}.

->>>>

So far in our documentation, we have detailed the introduction, the architecture, and the smart contracts of our blockchain project:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Smart Contracts:
{{step_3}}

Now, describe the consensus mechanisms in place, algorithms used, and reasons why they were chosen for your specific project: {{consensus_mechanism}}.

->>>>

We've discussed the introduction, architecture, smart contracts, and the consensus mechanism of the project in our "Code Documentation":

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Smart Contracts:
{{step_3}}

Consensus Mechanism:
{{step_4}}

Next, break down the process of how transactions are processed and recorded on the blockchain: {{transaction_processing}}.

->>>>

In our "Code Documentation", we've included explanations for the introduction, architecture, smart contracts, consensus mechanism, and transaction processing:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Smart Contracts:
{{step_3}}

Consensus Mechanism:
{{step_4}}

Transaction Processing:
{{step_5}}

After this, shed some light on the security measures and systems in place designed to protect the integrity of the blockchain: {{blockchain_security}}.

->>>>

In our "Code Documentation", we've discussed the introduction, architecture, smart contracts, consensus mechanism, transaction processing, and security measures of the project:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Architecture:
{{step_2}}

Smart Contracts:
{{step_3}}

Consensus Mechanism:
{{step_4}}

Transaction Processing:
{{step_5}}

Security Measures:
{{step_6}}

Next, include appendices that cover more complex or technical elements of code such as data structures and cryptographic functions: {{technical_appendices}}.
