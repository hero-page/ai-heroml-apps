Your task is to write an "Engagement Report" for the "Media & News Organizations" industry designed for a "Social Media Manager". First, start the report by providing an introduction that clearly mentions the time period you are analyzing: {{time_period}}. This should broadly explain the different social media performance metrics observed during this period.

Here's some more context about the Engagement Report:
Time Period: {{time_period}}
Engagement KPIs: {{engagement_KPIs}}
Platform Engagement: {{platform_engagement}}
Comparison: {{comparison}}
Content Type: {{content_type}}
Posting Schedule: {{posting_schedule}}
Influencers: {{influencers}}
Key Findings: {{key_findings}}

->>>>

Now, you have written an introduction to the Engagement Report:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, present a comprehensive analysis of the key performance indicators (KPIs) that you have investigated in relation to overall social media engagement: {{engagement_KPIs}}. This could include metrics such as likes, shares, comments, mentions, retweets, replies, and the time your audience spent on your content.

Having finished the introduction, you'll now have an analysis of the social media engagement KPIs:

Moving forward, perform a detailed analysis by separately examining engagement metrics for each social media platform: {{platform_engagement}}. Describe which forms of engagement were particularly high or low on each platform.

With an engagement KPIs analysis in hand, now we have a platform-specific engagement analysis:

Engagement KPIs:

Platform Engagement:
{{step_3}}

Now, provide a comparison of these findings to past performance or to industry benchmarks in the "Media & News Organizations" industry: {{comparison}}. This will offer a useful point of reference.

Having a platform-specific analysis, we now have a comparison to benchmarks or past performance:

Platform Engagement:
{{step_3}}

Comparison:
{{step_4}}

Next, analyze and detail the most engaging type of content (text, video, image, link, or combination): {{content_type}}. This part should cover an analysis of the length, tone, style, and topic of content that garnered the most engagement.

After developing a comparison, the next step is to distinguish the most engaging type of content:

Comparison:
{{step_4}}

Content Analysis:

Subsequently, discuss the impacts of posting times and dates: {{posting_schedule}}. Highlight the optimal times and days of the week to post for maximizing engagement.

Following the analysis of engaging content, you should now address the impact of posting times and dates:

Content Analysis:
{{step_5}}

Posting Schedule Analysis:
{{step_6}}

Now, list the top influencers or public figures who interacted with your organization's social media during your specified time period: {{influencers}}. Describe the nature of their engagement and the audience's response.

Upon analyzing the posting schedule, we can now specify the top influencers and their impact:

Finally, summarize your report with a review of key findings and trends observed from your analysis. Concretely address shifts in follower preferences, changes in peak engagement times, and other important trends: {{key_findings}}.
