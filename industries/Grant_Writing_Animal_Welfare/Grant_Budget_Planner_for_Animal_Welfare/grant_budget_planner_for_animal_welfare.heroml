Your task is to write a "Budget Details" for the "Grant Writing - Animal Welfare" industry, specifically for a "Grant Writer".
Let's start with an introduction that underscores the objective of the grant application: {{grant_objective}}. This can help give context to the budget details and their importance to the animal welfare project.
