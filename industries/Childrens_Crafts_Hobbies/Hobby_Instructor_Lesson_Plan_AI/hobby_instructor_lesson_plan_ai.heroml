Your task is to write a "Lesson Plan" for the "Children's Crafts & Hobbies" industry, specifically for a "Hobby Instructor". 
Let's start by composing an introduction, presenting the key theme of the lesson: {{lesson_theme}}. This will orient the students towards what they will be learning and doing during the class.

Here's some more context about the Lesson Plan:
Lesson Theme: {{lesson_theme}}
Learning Objectives: {{learning_objectives}}

->>>>

In our "Lesson Plan" for a "Hobby Instructor", we have an introduction:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Let's now articulate the learning objectives: {{learning_objectives}}. These objectives should be straightforward, and clearly state what skills or knowledge students will acquire by the end of the lesson.

->>>>

Our lesson plan now consists of an introduction, as well as learning objectives:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

To facilitate learning, we will divide our lesson into chunks or units. Each unit should teach or focus on a specific part of the {{lesson_theme}}. It should help in retaining the students' attention and maintaining the flow of teaching.

->>>>

Our lesson plan is taking shape, with an introduction, clear learning objectives, and well-structured units:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Units:
{{step_3}}

Practical exercises or tasks that reinforce the objectives: {{learning_objectives}} are critical in any lesson plan. Let's list out simple tasks related to the theme of the hobby, that help the students apply what they have learned.

->>>>

Our lesson plan now includes practical exercises along with the other components:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Units:
{{step_3}}

Practical Exercises:
{{step_4}}

To assess the students' understanding and competency, we need to incorporate a review or assessment procedure for {{lesson_theme}}. This can be an interactive question-answer session, individual project presentations, or simple quizzes.

->>>>

The components of our lesson plan include an interactive review process:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Units:
{{step_3}}

Practical Exercises:
{{step_4}}

Review Process:
{{step_5}}

Now let's write a conclusion that summarizes the lesson, reiterating the key points learned, and the skills developed during the course of {{lesson_theme}}.

->>>>

Our lesson plan is nearing completion. We've included a comprehensive conclusion together with the other components:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Learning Objectives:
{{step_2}}

Units:
{{step_3}}

Practical Exercises:
{{step_4}}

Review Process:
{{step_5}}

Conclusion:
{{step_6}}

To gather student responses, a feedback mechanism where students can share their thoughts about the lesson is essential. Time to draft one for {{lesson_theme}}.
