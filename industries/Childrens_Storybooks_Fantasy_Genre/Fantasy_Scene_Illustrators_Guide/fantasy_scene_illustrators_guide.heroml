Your task is to write a "Fantasy Scene Illustration Description" for the "Children's Storybooks - Fantasy Genre" industry, specifically for an "Illustrator". 
Let's begin by drafting a brief introduction that captures the overall ambiance of the scene. Recall that the setting should be described in brief terms: {{scene_setting}}.

Here's some more context about the Fantasy Scene Illustration Description:
Scene Setting: {{scene_setting}}
Main Elements: {{main_elements}}
Secondary Elements: {{secondary_elements}}
Scene Action: {{scene_action}}
Fantasy Elements: {{fantasy_elements}}
Scene Summary: {{scene_summary}}

Next, let's go into detail about the main elements in the scene. These can include characters, buildings, landscapes etc. Pay close attention to color, size, and other specific features: {{main_elements}}.

Based on our scene settings and following our detailed description of the main elements, we have:

Moving forward, we need to describe the secondary elements present in the scene. These could be additional characters, props, smaller landscape details. Be sure to indicate their relationship to the main elements of the scene: {{secondary_elements}}.
