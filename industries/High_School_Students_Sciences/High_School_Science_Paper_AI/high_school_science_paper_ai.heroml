Now, we have an abstract for our Research Paper:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

On the basis of this abstract, let's design an introduction reflecting upon the scientific principle or theory: {{scientific_principle}} related to our research topic.

->>>>

Our Research Paper has an Abstract and an Introduction:

Abstract:
{{step_1}}

Introduction:
{{step_2}}

Now, under the 'Objectives' or 'Hypothesis' section, outline the main aim of our research: {{research_objective}}, and define the assumptions we are planning to test.
