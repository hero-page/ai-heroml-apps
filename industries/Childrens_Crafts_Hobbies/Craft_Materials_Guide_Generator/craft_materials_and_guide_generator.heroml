Your task is to create a "Materials List" for the "Children's Crafts & Hobbies" industry for a "Craft Author". Let's start with an introduction that describes the craft project: {{craft_project}}. This introduction should give a brief overview of the craft project and why it is engaging and fun for kids.

Here's some more context about the Materials List:
Craft Project: {{craft_project}}
Core Materials: {{core_materials}}
Material Preparation: {{material_preparation}}
Safety Considerations: {{safety_considerations}}
Care Maintenance: {{care_maintenance}}
Project Variations: {{project_variations}}

->>>>

Based on the description of the specific craft project:

{{step_1}}

Next, identify and list all the core materials needed for the craft project. This list should include the quantity of each material, distinguishing attributes (color, size, etc.), and any optional items that could enhance the craft but are not mandatory.

Now, create an organized, step-by-step guide on how to gather and prepare the materials. Explain where to purchase them, how to choose the best quality, and any necessary preparation such as washing, drying or trimming the materials.

Let's create a guide on material collection and preparation:

{{step_3}}

Having prepared our materials guide, let's detail any safety considerations when using these materials. This could encompass the use of scissors, glue, or small parts representing choking hazards.

We need to present the safety considerations for using these materials:

Safety Considerations:
{{step_4}}

Next, let's include a section on 'Materials Care & Maintenance'. This might incorporate how to clean and safely store the materials post-craft activity, plus tips to ensure their longevity.

Following our extensive safety considerations:

{{step_4}}

Our 'Materials Care & Maintenance' guide will look like this:

{{step_5}}

Now, let's suggest recommendations for variations and adaptations of the craft project. Propose alternative materials, themes or designs, explaining how these adjustments will refresh and invigorate the craft project each time.

After covering care and maintenance:

We will layout suggestions for future variations of the craft project in our:

Project Variations Guide:
{{step_6}}

Lastly, recap your materials list by restating the name of the craft project. Ensure you remind craft authors about the essence of making the craft engaging, fun, and safe for children.
