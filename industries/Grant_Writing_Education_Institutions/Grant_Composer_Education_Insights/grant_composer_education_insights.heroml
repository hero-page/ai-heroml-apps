Your task is to write a "Grant Application" for the "Grant Writing - Education Institutions" industry, specifically for a "Grant Writer". Let's begin by drafting a compelling summary of your institution and the proposed project.

Here's some more context about the Grant Application:
Institution And Project Summary: {{institution_and_project_summary}}
Educational Institution Description: {{educational_institution_description}}
Project Details: {{project_details}}
Problems And Beneficiaries: {{problems_and_beneficiaries}}
Project Timeline: {{project_timeline}}
Project Budget: {{project_budget}}
Sustainability Plan: {{sustainability_plan}}

->>>>

Now that we have a compelling summary:

Institution and Project Summary:
{{step_1}}

Next, craft an organisation background section providing an in-depth description of your educational institution, its mission, and its key achievements. Be sure to mention any noteworthy partnerships with reputable organisations, success stories that show your institutionâ€™s commitment towards better education, and your various educational offerings.

Moving forward, let's design a detailed project description that includes rationale, objectives, methods, and expected outcomes. Highlight the unique, innovative strategies, or educational techniques you plan to utilise, emphasising their potential for achieving the proposed objective effectively.

In the upcoming segment, elucidate on the need or beneficiaries for the project. Explain the problems the project will solve, and specify the demographic or community that stands to benefit from the project. Use statistics to quantify the problem and provide evidence that your project is targeting a significant issue in education.

Our project details and explanation of problems and beneficiaries are as follows:

Next, we need to create a budget section with a detailed overview of costs associated with the project. Detail any co-funding or partnership with other organizations to carry out your project and explain how you'll leverage this grant to achieve maximum impact.

Now we have a project timeline and a detailed budget for the project:

Last but not least, compose a sustainability plan explaining how the project will sustain itself in the long term after the grant period has ended.
