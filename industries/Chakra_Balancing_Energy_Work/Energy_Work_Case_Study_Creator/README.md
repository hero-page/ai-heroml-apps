## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./energy_work_case_study_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./energy_work_case_study_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./energy_work_case_study_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./energy_work_case_study_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./energy_work_case_study_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Energy Work Case Study Creator
```
Your task is to write a "Client Anonymized Case Study" for the "Chakra Balancing & Energy Work" industry, specifically for an "Energy Worker". 

Start by generating a powerful introduction for this case study that outlines the core issue or goal. This case could be about a client's struggle with physical, emotional, or spiritual imbalances, for instance, {{client_issue}}.

Here's some more context about the Client Anonymized Case Study:
Client Issue: {{client_issue}}
Client ID: {{client_ID}}
Chakra Techniques Used: {{chakra_techniques_used}}
Client Progress: {{client_progress}}
Client Outcome: {{client_outcome}}

->>>>

We now have a potent introduction for our case study:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Then, create a succinct description of the client's background and the reasons why they sought energy work. Since the client's data should be anonymized, stay away from particular personal identifiers and employ coded identifiers such as {{client_ID}}.

->>>>

Our case study contains an introduction and a brief client background, which is anonymized:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Client Background:
{{step_2}}

Next, describe in detail the energy worker's approach to handling the client's problem. This should encompass the client's energy and chakra assessments, the specific challenges uncovered, and the variety of energy work techniques implemented, such as {{chakra_techniques_used}}.

->>>>

Our case study currently includes the client's background and a detailed description of the energy worker's approach:

Client Background:
{{step_2}}

Energy Worker's Approach:
{{step_3}}

Now, let's expand on the progression of the treatment, pointing out the setbacks and breakthroughs experienced along the way. Share information on the client's response to the techniques or on how their energy levels were affected, for example, {{client_progress}}.

->>>>

Our case study now includes the client's progression through treatment:

Client Background:
{{step_2}}

Progress Report:
{{step_4}}

Now, to highlight the results of the energy work, provide tangible examples of how the client’s quality of life improved following the energy balancing treatments. Without violating confidentiality, detail changes in the client’s physical health, emotional wellbeing, or spiritual growth, such as {{client_outcome}}.

->>>>

We now have a report that includes the results of the energy work:

Progress Report:
{{step_4}}

Outcome Report:
{{step_5}}

Next, keep the case study relevant to the industry by incorporating terminologies and concepts particular to energy work, including types of chakras, energy cleansing, aura readings, healing vibrations, and energy flow. This not only adds relevance to the case study, but it also educates readers on the depth of the energy work field.
