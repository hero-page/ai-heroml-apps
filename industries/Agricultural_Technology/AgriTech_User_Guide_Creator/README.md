## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./agri_tech_user_guide_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./agri_tech_user_guide_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./agri_tech_user_guide_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./agri_tech_user_guide_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./agri_tech_user_guide_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Agri-Tech User Guide Creator
```
Let's write a User Guide for the "Agricultural Technology" industry for an "Agri-Tech Engineer". 

Start by creating an introduction that explains the purpose of the agricultural technology: {{agri_tech_purpose}}. It should provide an overview of the tool or equipment and its functional significance for an Agri-Tech Engineer.

Here's some more context about the User Guide:
Agri Tech Purpose: {{agri_tech_purpose}}
Agri Tech Setup: {{agri_tech_setup}}
Agri Tech Operation: {{agri_tech_operation}}
Agri Tech Performance: {{agri_tech_performance}}
Agri Tech Troubleshooting: {{agri_tech_troubleshooting}}
Agri Tech Sustainability: {{agri_tech_sustainability}}
Agri Tech Support: {{agri_tech_support}}

->>>>

In our User Guide, we have an introduction covering the purpose of this agricultural technology:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Moving on, describe a detailed step-by-step process for the setup and installation of the agricultural technology: {{agri_tech_setup}}. Include precautions to ensure safety during setup.

->>>>

Our User Guide now has both, an introduction and a setup & installation guide:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Setup & Installation:
{{step_2}}

Next, create a section detailing User Instructions for operating the agricultural technology: {{agri_tech_operation}}. Include information about regular maintenance practices.

->>>>

To the existing sections of our User Guide, we've added User Instructions:

Setup & Installation:
{{step_2}}

User Instructions:
{{step_3}}

Now, provide insights on the Performance and Efficiency of the technology. Describe how the user can measure and interpret the performance data to assess the efficiency of the technology: {{agri_tech_performance}}.

->>>>

So far, in our User Guide, we've detailed out instructions and added a section on Performance and Efficiency:

User Instructions:
{{step_3}}

Performance & Efficiency:
{{step_4}}

Next, let's create a Troubleshooting section. This should provide solutions for common problems that could occur with the technology: {{agri_tech_troubleshooting}}. Include diagnostic steps to identify issues and provide resolution measures.

->>>>

Our guide now has a troubleshooting section alongside previously included insights.

Performance & Efficiency:
{{step_4}}

Troubleshooting:
{{step_5}}

Now, let's examine the Sustainable Practices associated with the use of the technology. Include any procedures that help in conservation of resources or reducing environmental impact when using the equipment/tool: {{agri_tech_sustainability}}.

->>>>

In our guide, we've incorporated further sections. Now, we also describe sustainable practices:

Troubleshooting:
{{step_5}}

Sustainable Practices:
{{step_6}}

We're almost there. Now, write a Support section to provide users with information about getting additional help for the technology: {{agri_tech_support}}. Include contact channels, operational hours, and resolution timeframes, if relevant.

->>>>

Let's see the progress on our guide.

Sustainable Practices:
{{step_6}}

Support:
{{step_7}}

Finally, create a conclusion to reiterate the purpose and benefits of this agricultural technology: {{agri_tech_purpose}}. This should serve as a summary of the guide.
