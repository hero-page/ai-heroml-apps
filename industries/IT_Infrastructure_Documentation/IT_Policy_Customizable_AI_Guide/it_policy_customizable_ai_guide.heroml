Your task is to write a "IT Policies and Procedures" for the "IT Infrastructure Documentation" industry, specifically for a "IT Manager". Let's begin by generating an introduction that outlines the purpose of the "IT Policies and Procedures": {{IT_policy_purpose}}. This section should explain what the document is, why it is necessary, and what it aims to achieve.

Here's some more context about the IT Policies and Procedures:
IT Policy Purpose: {{IT_policy_purpose}}
IT Scope: {{IT_scope}}
IT Policies: {{IT_policies}}
IT Procedures: {{IT_procedures}}
Incident Handling: {{incident_handling}}
Compliance Requirements: {{compliance_requirements}}

->>>>

Now, we have an introduction for our IT Policies and Procedures:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, create a section detailing the scope of the IT policies and procedures: {{IT_scope}}. Define the users these policies and procedures apply to, the kinds of IT resources covered, and in which situations they should be applied.

->>>>

Following the introduction, we have also defined the scope of our IT Policies and Procedures:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Scope of the IT Policies and Procedures:
{{step_2}}

Now, present a section detailing the IT policies: {{IT_policies}}, aimed to guide the behaviour of users regarding IT resource usage. Each policy must state the policy's purpose, to whom it applies, and its core rules or principles.

->>>>

We have the introduction, scope, and now the IT Policies for our guide:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Scope of the IT Policies and Procedures:
{{step_2}}

IT Policies:
{{step_3}}

Next, design a section to detail the IT procedures: {{IT_procedures}}. These are the step-by-step operational processes that your organization requires for the management and consistency of IT resources.

->>>>

We have the IT Policies and now gained the IT Procedures for our guide:

IT Policies:
{{step_3}}

IT Procedures:
{{step_4}}

Subsequently, create a section dedicated to incident handling and reporting: {{incident_handling}}. Provide guidelines for identifying, reporting, tracking, and resolving IT incidents.

->>>>

We have the IT Procedures and a section for Incident Handling and Reporting:

IT Procedures:
{{step_4}}

Incident Handling and Reporting:
{{step_5}}

Now, let's formulate a section for IT compliance requirements: {{compliance_requirements}}. Discuss laws, regulations, and standards your policies and procedures align with.

->>>>

For the IT Policies and Procedures, we have an Incident Handling and Reporting section, as well as a Compliance Requirements section:

Incident Handling and Reporting:
{{step_5}}

Compliance Requirements:
{{step_6}}

To conclude, create a section explaining how and when the "IT Policies and Procedures" should be reviewed, who is responsible for the task, and how changes are communicated to relevant parties.
