Your task is to write a "Conference Presentation" for the "Academic & University" industry, specifically for a "Graduate Student". Let's start by creating an attention-grabbing introduction that sets the context and speaks about the motivation behind the research: {{research_motivation}}.

Here's some more context about the Conference Presentation:
Research Motivation: {{research_motivation}}
Research Question: {{research_question}}
Research Methods: {{research_methods}}
Major Findings: {{major_findings}}

->>>>

We now have an introduction to our presentation:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Following the introduction, let's form a research question, hypothesis, or objective, hereafter referred to as {{research_question}}.

->>>>

We now have the introduction and the research question for our presentation:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Research Question:
{{step_2}}

Next, we need to explain the methodologies i.e., {{research_methods}}, that were used during the process of this research.

->>>>

We now have the introduction, research question, and methodology for our presentation:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Research Question:
{{step_2}}

Methodologies:
{{step_3}}

Following this, let's present the major findings or key arguments, also called as {{major_findings}}, that this research has yielded.

Up to now, we have prepared the introduction, research question, methodology, and major findings for our presentation:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Research Question:
{{step_2}}

Methodologies:
{{step_3}}

Major Findings:
{{step_4}}

Now, we need to discuss the implications of these findings in relation to existing theories and previous research. We also want to present new questions that these findings raise for future research.

We now have a discussion on the existing theories, previous research and new questions for future research in relation to our major findings:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Research Question:
{{step_2}}

Major Findings:
{{step_4}}

Discussion of Findings:
{{step_5}}

To wrap this all up, let's produce a summary for the presentation. 

This should include reiteration of the research question and the impact of the findings on the larger conversation within the field.
