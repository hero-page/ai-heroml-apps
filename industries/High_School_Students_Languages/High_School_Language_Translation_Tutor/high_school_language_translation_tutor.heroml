Your task is to create a "Translation Exercise" for the "High School Students - Languages" industry for a "Student". Let's start by framing an introduction that outlines the purpose of this exercise: {{exercise_purpose}}.

Here's some more context about the Translation Exercise:
Exercise Purpose: {{exercise_purpose}}
Target Text: {{target_text}}
Text Sections: {{text_sections}}
Exercise Summary: {{exercise_summary}}

->>>>

The introduction for the translation exercise is:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, select a relevant text or series of sentences that aligns with the current proficiency level and learning objectives of the student: {{target_text}}.

->>>>

The selected text for our translation exercise is:

Selected Text:
{{step_2}}

Now let's break down this selected text into manageable sections: {{text_sections}}.

->>>>

After partitioning the text, the breakdown is as follows:

Text Sections:
{{step_3}}

Let's provide a comprehensive list of vocabulary and idiomatic expressions present in the {{target_text}} with their meanings and usage in the target language.

->>>>

The vocab list from our text is:

Vocabulary List: 
{{step_4}}

Next, instruct the student to translate the {{text_sections}} into the target language, stimulating them to utilize the provided vocabulary and expressions.

{{step_4}}

Let's create an accurate translation of each {{text_sections}} for the student to use as a reference.

->>>>

We have a translation for each section:

Translation:
{{step_6}}

Now, let's frame follow-up questions for each {{text_sections}} to check understanding and gauge the student's application of newly learned vocabulary or sentence structures.

Using the translation:

We've made follow-up questions:

Follow-up Questions:
{{step_7}}

To wrap up, let's form a summary that reviews the main lessons and vocabulary from the translated text: {{exercise_summary}} along with motivation for students to employ this new learning in future language practice.
