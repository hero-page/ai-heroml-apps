Your task is to write a "Personal Experience" for the "Ecotherapy & Nature Connection" industry, specifically for a "Nature Coach". 

Let's start by creating an introduction that sets the scene of your interaction with nature: {{nature_interaction}}. Dive into the emotions you experienced, the unique environment you were in, and what drew you to this line of work. Establish what you hope to bring out in people through coaching.

Here's some more context about the Personal Experience:
Nature Interaction: {{nature_interaction}}
Personal Experience: {{personal_experience}}
Client Outcome 1: {{client_outcome_1}}
Client Outcome 2: {{client_outcome_2}}
Nature Elements: {{nature_elements}}
