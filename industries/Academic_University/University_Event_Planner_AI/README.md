## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./university_event_planner_ai.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./university_event_planner_ai.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./university_event_planner_ai.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./university_event_planner_ai.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./university_event_planner_ai.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for University Event Planner AI
```
Your task is to write an "Event Plan" for the "Academic & University" industry, specifically for a "Student Affairs Officer". 

Start by crafting an introduction to the event plan, set the context and clarify the purpose of the event. The introduction should be succinct and compelling: {{event_purpose}}.

Here's some more context about the Event Plan:
Event Purpose: {{event_purpose}}
Target Audience: {{target_audience}}
Event Timeline: {{event_timeline}}
Required Resources: {{required_resources}}
Intended Outcomes: {{intended_outcomes}}
Risk Management: {{risk_management}}

->>>>

Now, we have created an introduction and the purpose of the event:

Introduction & Purpose:
{{step_1}}

Next, let's identify and clearly state the target audience for the event, which may include specific student groups, faculty members, or the entire university body: {{target_audience}}.

->>>>

For our event plan, we've identified:

Introduction & Purpose:
{{step_1}}

Target Audience:
{{step_2}}

Proceeding further, let's craft a timeline detailing the activities to be performed in the preparation, execution, and post-event phases. This should outline the sequence of actions and key milestones for the event: {{event_timeline}}.

->>>>

For our event plan, we have the following components:

Introduction & Purpose:
{{step_1}}

Target Audience:
{{step_2}}

Event Timeline:
{{step_3}}

Next, list the resources required for the event, both human (volunteers, guest speakers, etc.) and material (venue, supplies, etc.). Also, outline a plan explaining how these resources will be mobilized efficiently: {{required_resources}}.

->>>>

Until now, our event plan has:

Introduction & Purpose:
{{step_1}}

Event Timeline:
{{step_3}}

Required Resources & Mobilization:
{{step_4}}

Now, let's explain the expected outcomes of the event. Define the qualitative (like satisfaction and engagement) and quantitative (like attendance rate, surveys) measures to evaluate event's success: {{intended_outcomes}}.

->>>>

For our event plan:

Introduction & Purpose:
{{step_1}}

Required Resources & Mobilization:
{{step_4}}

Intended Outcomes:
{{step_5}}

Now, anticipate potential risks and craft a risk management strategy. Consider unexpected challenges such as weather conditions, low turnout, or other unforeseen circumstances and draw up backup plans: {{risk_management}}.

->>>>

Our event plan so far includes:

Introduction & Purpose:
{{step_1}}

Intended Outcomes:
{{step_5}}

Risk Management:
{{step_6}}

Now, conclude the event plan by restating the purpose: {{event_purpose}}. Summarize the plan's key points and include language that incites voluntary participation in the event.

->>>>

The event plan now includes:

Introduction & Purpose:
{{step_1}}

Risk Management:
{{step_6}}

Conclusion & Voluntary Participation:
{{step_7}}

Lastly, bearing in mind that the event is in an academic setting, where stakeholders range from students and parents to staff and alumni, ensure to include industry-specific considerations influencing the event structure. Use this understanding to align the event plan with the academic calendar and respect academic policies and procedures.
