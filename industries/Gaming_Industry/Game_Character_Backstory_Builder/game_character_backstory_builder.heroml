Your task is to write a detailed "Character Backstory" for the "Gaming Industry" industry, for a "Game Writer". 
Let's start with the basic information of the character where you should include: {{character_name}}, their role in the game storyline: {{character_role}}, their race/species: {{character_race}}, and their class or occupation: {{character_class}}.

Here's some more context about the Character Backstory:
Character Name: {{character_name}}
Character Role: {{character_role}}
Character Race: {{character_race}}
Character Class: {{character_class}}
Character Home: {{character_home}}
Character Traits: {{character_traits}}
Character Abilities: {{character_abilities}}
