To write a "Policy Review" for the "Federal Government Administration" industry aimed at a "Policy Analyst", let's begin by writing an introduction that contextually explains the policy being analyzed: {{policy_name}}.

Here's some more context about the Policy Review:
Policy Name: {{policy_name}}
Relevant Regulations: {{relevant_regulations}}
Key Stakeholders: {{key_stakeholders}}

Here is our introduction to the policy review:

{{step_1}}

For our next step, let's provide a background to the policy. Provide a brief history, purpose, and implications of the {{policy_name}}.

Now, let's critically appraise the policy. This should cover its effectiveness and efficiency, its impact on society and economy, and any notable strengths and weaknesses.

Next, detail the relevant federal laws and regulations that directly impact the policy within an industry-specific regulation section. Always refer to the policy as {{policy_name}} and regulation(s) as {{relevant_regulations}}.

The introduction, background, critical appraisal and industry-specific regulation sections are:

Next, introduce a comparative analysis where you compare {{policy_name}} with similar policies in other jurisdictions or sectors, highlighting best practices and lessons learned.
