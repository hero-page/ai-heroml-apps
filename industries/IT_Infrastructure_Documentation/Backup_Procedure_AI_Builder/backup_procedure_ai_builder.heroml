Your task is to write a "Backup Procedure" for the "IT Infrastructure Documentation" industry, specifically for a "System Administrator".
Let's begin with an introduction that outlines the purpose and contents of the "Backup Procedure" with the context of {{backup_purpose}}.

Here's some more context about the Backup Procedure:
Backup Purpose: {{backup_purpose}}
System Environment: {{system_environment}}
Data Details: {{data_details}}
Backup Schedule: {{backup_schedule}}

->>>>

We have an introduction for our "Backup Procedure".

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, establish the background context by explaining the system environment that the procedure targets: {{system_environment}}.

->>>>

We have provided a context for our "Backup Procedure".

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Now, let's describe in detail the data to be backed up, including aspects such as location, size, and format: {{data_details}}.

->>>>

The "Backup Procedure" now consists of the following sections:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Data Details:
{{step_3}}

Moving on, construct the step-by-step process for executing the backup procedure, tailored to the {{system_environment}}.

->>>>

Our Backup Procedure is taking shape with:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Data Details:
{{step_3}}

Backup Procedure Steps:
{{step_4}}

Let's now highlight the essential software and hardware requirements to implement the backup procedure for the given {{system_environment}}.

->>>>

The "Backup Procedure" now includes software and hardware requirements:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Data Details:
{{step_3}}

Backup Procedure Steps:
{{step_4}}

Requirements:
{{step_5}}

Next, specify the backup schedule, explaining the frequency and timing of the backup tasks: {{backup_schedule}}.

->>>>

Our Backup Procedure now has a schedule:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Data Details:
{{step_3}}

Backup Procedure Steps:
{{step_4}}

Requirements:
{{step_5}}

Backup Schedule:
{{step_6}}

Following this, discuss the plan for verifying the backups to ensure data has been correctly copied and stored.

->>>>

The "Backup Procedure" includes a verification plan:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Data Details:
{{step_3}}

Backup Procedure Steps:
{{step_4}}

Requirements:
{{step_5}}

Backup Schedule:
{{step_6}}

Verification Plan:
{{step_7}}

Next, let's incorporate a data recovery procedure explaining how to restore data from the backup in the event of a system failure.

->>>>

Our current Backup Procedure includes:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Data Details:
{{step_3}}

Backup Procedure Steps:
{{step_4}}

Requirements:
{{step_5}}

Backup Schedule:
{{step_6}}

Verification Plan:
{{step_7}}

Data Recovery Procedure:
{{step_8}}

Now, conclude the procedure by providing a maintenance and review schedule, stating how often the procedure should be updated or revisited due to changes in the {{system_environment}}.

->>>>

We are almost done with the procedure, which now includes a maintenance and review schedule:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Data Details:
{{step_3}}

Backup Procedure Steps:
{{step_4}}

Requirements:
{{step_5}}

Backup Schedule:
{{step_6}}

Verification Plan:
{{step_7}}

Data Recovery Procedure:
{{step_8}}

Maintenance and Review Schedule:
{{step_9}}

Now, let's create a glossary of likely error messages and their corresponding troubleshooting measures, keeping them relevant to the {{system_environment}}.

->>>>

The procedure has been further enhanced with a glossary of error messages:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Background Context:
{{step_2}}

Data Details:
{{step_3}}

Backup Procedure Steps:
{{step_4}}

Requirements:
{{step_5}}

Backup Schedule:
{{step_6}}

Verification Plan:
{{step_7}}

Data Recovery Procedure:
{{step_8}}

Maintenance and Review Schedule:
{{step_9}}

Error Messages Glossary:
{{step_10}}

Let's now include contact information for technical support or any further queries related to the backup procedure.
