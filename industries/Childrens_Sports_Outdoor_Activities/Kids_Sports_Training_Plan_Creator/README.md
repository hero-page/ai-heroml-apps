## Run with HeroCLI (Requires OpenAI Token)

#### Installation

To install the HeroML CLI tool, you need to have Node.js and npm (comes with Node.js) installed on your machine. If you don't have these, please install them first. 

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g heroml
```

This will install the HeroML CLI tool globally on your system, allowing you to use the `hero` command from any directory.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can run:

```bash
npm install heroml
```

and use it like:

```bash
npx hero run ./kids_sports_training_plan_creator.heroml
```

We'll be using `hero run ...` in this tutorial for simplicity.

#### Configuration

Before using the HeroML CLI tool, you need to configure your OpenAI API key. 

Create a `heroconfig.json` file in your home directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "your-openai-api-key"
}
```

Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

#### Usage

To run a HeroML script, use the `run` command followed by the path to your script:

```bash
hero run ./kids_sports_training_plan_creator.heroml
```

You can provide initial variable values as command-line options. For example, if your script expects a variable named `number_of_colors`, you can provide its value as follows:

```bash
hero run --number_of_colors 4 ./kids_sports_training_plan_creator.heroml
```

If you do not provide a value for a variable, the HeroML CLI tool will prompt you to enter it interactively.

### Output Options

You can specify the output directory and the filename of the output file using command-line options:

- The `-o` or `--output-dir` option allows you to specify the output directory. By default, it is `./outputs/`.

```bash
hero run --output-dir /custom/output/directory ./kids_sports_training_plan_creator.heroml
```

- The `-f` or `--filename` option allows you to specify the filename of the output file. By default, it is `response_TIMESTAMP.json`.

```bash
hero run --filename custom_filename.json ./kids_sports_training_plan_creator.heroml
```

The CLI tool writes the output to a JSON file in the specified directory. It will print the path of the output file to the console:

```bash
Success! Output written to /custom/output/directory/custom_filename.json
```


## HeroML AI Steps for Kid's Sports Training Plan Creator
```
Your task is to write a "Training Plan" specifically for a "Sports Coach" operating in the "Children's Sports & Outdoor Activities" industry. 

Let's start by crafting a compelling introduction about the significance of sports training for children. Be sure to underscore the {{desired_outcome}}, which represents the specific skills or growth areas the training plan will concentrate on.

Here's some more context about the Training Plan:
Desired Outcome: {{desired_outcome}}
Target Group: {{target_group}}
Core Activities: {{core_activities}}
Engagement Techniques: {{engagement_techniques}}

->>>>

Now, we have a captivating introduction detailing the importance of sports training:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, delve into a comprehensive description of the {{target_group}}. This refers mainly to the age group and ability level of the participating children. Keep in mind parameters such as age-appropriate skills, physical development limitations, and experience levels.

->>>>

In our "Training Plan", we have an introduction and a detailed description of our target group:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Target Group Description:
{{step_2}}

Now, let's outline the main training activities. The {{core_activities}} are the base exercises or sports activities to be performed in order to attain your desired outcome. Layout these activities in a systematic order, explaining how to execute them, the safety guidelines, and the projected benefits for each activity.

->>>>

In our "Training Plan", we have:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Target Group Description:
{{step_2}}

Core Activities:
{{step_3}}

Next, include a "Feedback & Progress Tracking" section that outlines an organized approach for monitoring each child's progress. Illustrate how the sports coach can customize the {{core_activities}} based on individual needs, track progress, and sustain an open dialogue with parents.

->>>>

Our "Training Plan" now consists of these sections:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Target Group Description:
{{step_2}}

Core Activities:
{{step_3}}

Feedback & Progress Tracking:
{{step_4}}

Moving forward, discuss additional techniques focused on increasing children's engagement. The variable {{engagement_techniques}} can encompass strategies such as enjoyable competition, teamwork-focused exercises, reward systems, or integrating educational elements in a lively manner.

->>>>

For our "Training Plan", we have these segments:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Target Group Description:
{{step_2}}

Core Activities:
{{step_3}}

Feedback & Progress Tracking:
{{step_4}}

Engagement Techniques:
{{step_5}}

Finally, write a conclusion that summarizes the core components of the training plan. Echo the {{desired_outcome}}, its impact on children's development, and the key strategies implemented to achieve this outcome.
