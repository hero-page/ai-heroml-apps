Your task is to write a "Voice Consistency Feedback" for the "Ghostwriting" industry, specifically for an "Editor".

Start by stating the overall aim of the "Voice Consistency Feedback", which is to ensure that the voice and tone remain consistent throughout a document. Inform the Editor that you'll be assessing their work using the set parameters: {{overarching_voice}}, {{character_voices}}, {{narrative_consistency}}, {{narrative_flow}}, and {{technical_language}}.

Here's some more context about the Voice Consistency Feedback:
Overarching Voice: {{overarching_voice}}
Character Voices: {{character_voices}}
Narrative Consistency: {{narrative_consistency}}
Narrative Flow: {{narrative_flow}}
Technical Language: {{technical_language}}

At this point, we've stated the aim of the feedback:

{{step_1}}

Next, create an introduction to present the general impressions the Editor's work gave off regarding voice consistency. This involves offering initial observations and determining how closely the writing aligns with the set parameters of {{overarching_voice}} and {{character_voices}}.

Next, provide specific feedback for each dynamic variable separately. Discuss how effectively the {{overarching_voice}} pervades throughout the text and give insights about {{character_voices}}. Analyse the {{narrative_consistency}}, examine the {{narrative_flow}}, and discuss the use of {{technical_language}}.
