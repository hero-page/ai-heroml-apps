Your task is to write a "Project Implementation Strategy" for the "Grant Writing - Community Development" industry, specifically for a "Community Planner". 

Let's start with an executive summary that overviews the project topic: {{project_topic}}. This is where you briefly summarize your intended project and its goals to hook the reader.

Here's some more context about the Project Implementation Strategy:
Project Topic: {{project_topic}}
Community Need: {{community_need}}
Development Trends: {{development_trends}}
Beneficiaries Description: {{beneficiaries_description}}
Project Measures: {{project_measures}}
Success Indicators: {{success_indicators}}
Implementation Timeline: {{implementation_timeline}}
Project Budget: {{project_budget}}

->>>>

For a "Project Implementation Strategy", we have started off with the Executive Summary:

Executive Summary:
{{step_1}}

Next, we need an introduction focusing on the community's need: {{community_need}}. The introduction should also outline the project objectives.

In the "Project Implementation Strategy", following the Planned Measures, we've defined the Outcomes and Success Indicators:

Planned Measures:
{{step_5}}

Outcomes and Success Indicators:
{{step_6}}

Let's continue by detailing the project implementation timeline: {{implementation_timeline}}, and provide a budget necessary for the project: {{project_budget}}. This offers a realistic look at when and how the project will happen, and the financial resources it would require.
