Your task is to write a "Project Plan" for the "High School Students - Sciences" industry, specifically for a "Robotics Club Member".

Let's start by writing an introduction that explains the goal of the project: {{project_goal}}.

Here's some more context about the Project Plan:
Project Goal: {{project_goal}}
Project Challenge: {{project_challenge}}
Project Solution Idea: {{project_solution_idea}}
Project Methodology: {{project_methodology}}
Project Resources: {{project_resources}}
Project Timeline: {{project_timeline}}
Project Evaluation Criteria: {{project_evaluation_criteria}}

->>>>

We now have an introduction and the project goal for our plan:

Introduction & Project Goal:
{{step_1}}

Next, describe the problem or challenge the project is aiming to address: {{project_challenge}}. Frame this in terms of a question you're attempting to answer or a solution you're working towards.

->>>>

We have the project goal and the defined challenge our project aims to solve:

Project Goal:
{{step_1}}

Project Challenge:
{{step_2}}

Now, provide an overview of the proposed solution or idea for the project: {{project_solution_idea}}. This might be a blueprint or concept of a robot you plan to build or a software algorithm you want to develop.

->>>>

We have our project challenge and a proposed solution:

Project Challenge:
{{step_2}}

Project Solution/Idea:
{{step_3}}

Next, design a methodology section that outlines the steps to execute the project: {{project_methodology}}. This should guide the work of the club from the start to finish, detailing tasks such as designing, building, testing, and refining the robot.

->>>>

Based on the project solution or idea, here is our methodology for the execution:

Project Solution/Idea:
{{step_3}}

Project Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Now, identify the resources required for the project: {{project_resources}}. These might range from physical materials for the robot, software tools, or specific expertise from club members or mentors.

->>>>

After defining the project methodology, we have also identified the resources needed for the project: 

Project Methodology:
{{step_4}}

Project Resources:
{{step_5}}

Proceed to outline a timeline for the project. Break down the project into smaller tasks, assign tasks to specific team members, and set deadlines for each task: {{project_timeline}}. This will account for progress tracking and timely task completion.

->>>>

Based on the resources we have, this is our projected timeline:

Project Resources:
{{step_5}}

Project Timeline:
{{step_6}}

Finally, detail how the results of the project will be evaluated: {{project_evaluation_criteria}}. This could be based on aspects like the robot's performance, level of innovation, and functionality.
