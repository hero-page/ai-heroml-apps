Your task is to write a "Position Paper" for the "High School Students - Humanities" industry, specifically for a "Debate Club Member". For creating this "Position Paper", let's begin with the first part. 

1. Write an introduction that clearly states your position on the debate topic: {{debate_topic}}. Your position should be a part of a strong, declarative statement that summarizes your stance on the issue.

Here's some more context about the Position Paper:
