Your task is to write a "Tour Itinerary" for the "Hospitality & Tourism" industry, specifically for a "Tour Operator". Begin by drafting an introduction that provides a brief overview of the tour: {{tour_overview}}. Be sure to include the general destination, the duration of the tour, and a succinct description of what the tour aims to offer.

Here's some more context about the Tour Itinerary:
Tour Overview: {{tour_overview}}
Target Group: {{target_group}}
Daily Activities: {{daily_activities}}
Accommodation: {{accommodation}}
Transportation: {{transportation}}

At this point, we have an overview for our tour:

Next, let's define our target group for the tour: {{target_group}}. This could be families, solo travelers, adventure seekers, wildlife enthusiasts, etc. Clear definition of our target group will allow us to tailor the tour itinerary more effectively to their needs and interests.
