Your task is to write a "Policy Proposal" for the "Federal Government Administration" industry as an "Economic Advisor".

Let's start by developing an executive summary that provides a concise overview of the proposed policy.

Here's some more context about the Policy Proposal:
Policy Overview: {{policy_overview}}
Economic Background: {{economic_background}}
Policy Goals: {{policy_goals}}
Current State: {{current_state}}
Implementation Details: {{implementation_details}}

Now, we have an executive summary for our policy proposal:

Executive Summary:

We have a thorough analysis of the current state:

Current State Analysis:

With the completion of the conclusion:

Conclusion:
{{step_9}}

Finally, let's compile a comprehensive list of references to support the policy proposal. These references could include relevant case studies, statistics, or research papers.
