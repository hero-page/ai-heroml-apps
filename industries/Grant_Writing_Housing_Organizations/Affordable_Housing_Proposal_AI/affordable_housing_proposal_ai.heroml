Your task is to write an "Affordable Housing Project Proposal" for the "Grant Writing - Housing Organizations" industry, as a "Grant Writer". 

Let's start by creating an executive summary. This summary should overview the housing project: {{housing_project}} and immediately capture the essence of your proposal while providing a brief highlight of the project. 

Here's some more context about the Affordable Housing Project Proposal:
Housing Project: {{housing_project}}
Current Housing Situation: {{current_housing_situation}}
Target Community Traits: {{target_community_traits}}
Unique Housing Characteristics: {{unique_housing_characteristics}}
Partnerships And Resources: {{partnerships_and_resources}}

Expected Community Impact: {{expected_community_impact}}
Reiteration Of Project Goals And Request For Consideration: {{reiteration_of_project_goals_and_request_for_consideration}}

Our proposal will have an executive summary as follows:

In our proposal, the problem statement reads:

Our budget proposal for the project is laid out as:

Budget Proposal:
{{step_6}}

Next, talk about the project's impact. Describe how the affordable housing project will positively influence the community, including metrics for success or benchmarks for measuring progress, economic benefits, and improved standards of living: {{expected_community_impact}}.

To wrap up our proposal, reiterate the project goals and target benefits to the community. Also express your readiness to cooperate with the grant agency and other stakeholders, requesting for a favorable consideration: {{reiteration_of_project_goals_and_request_for_consideration}}.

{{step_8}}

Finally, to bolster the proposal's relevance to the 'Housing Organizations' industry, let's integrate the following elements into your proposal:
- Pertinent housing laws and regulations
- Alignment of your project with local, regional, or national housing development goals
- Explicit linkage of the project to the resolution or mitigation of significant societal issues such as homelessness or gentrification
- Drawing on successful examples of affordable housing projects and lessons learned from less successful ones.

Please adjust the proposal accordingly. 

While infusing these elements, do not alter the content produced in the previous steps substantially. Rather, it should feel as if these points have been an intrinsic part of the proposal all along. 

By doing this, the compliance of your proposal with industry standards and regulations is guaranteed.
