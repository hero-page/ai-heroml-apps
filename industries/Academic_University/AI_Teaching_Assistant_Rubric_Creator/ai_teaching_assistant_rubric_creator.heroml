Your task is to write a "Marking Rubric" for the "Academic & University" industry, specifically for a "Teaching Assistant". 

Let's begin by outlining the purpose of this "Marking Rubric". Also, describe the course or application it's being used for: {{course_name}}. Provide some background information to contextualize its use. 

Here's some more context about the Marking Rubric:
Course Name: {{course_name}}

->>>>

We have outlined the purpose of our "Marking Rubric" and provided background on the course:

Purpose and Course Description: 
{{step_1}}

Next, define multiple criteria or tasks for assessment. 
These criteria should relate directly to the required skills, knowledge, or understanding expected from students in {{course_name}}. The criteria could include specific assignments, projects, participation level, etc.

->>>>

We have a purpose and assessment criteria for our "Marking Rubric":

Purpose and Course Description: 
{{step_1}}

Assessment Criteria: 
{{step_2}}

Now, assign performance levels to each criterion defined earlier. 
Consider classifying performance into at least 3 categories: "Exceeds Expectations," "Meets Expectations," and "Does not Meet Expectations".

->>>>

At this point, we have established the assessment criteria and performance levels:

Assessment Criteria: 
{{step_2}}

Performance Levels: 
{{step_3}}

Next, write a clear description of what each performance level entails for each criterion. 
Remember that these descriptions will guide your grading and should align with the nature of the course or assignment: {{course_name}}.

->>>>

We now have descriptions for each performance level under each criterion:

Assessment Criteria: 
{{step_2}}

Performance Levels and Descriptions: 
{{step_4}}

Assign points or percentage weights to each performance level under each criterion. 
This will form the basis of the student's overall course score in {{course_name}}.

->>>>

So far, we've defined criteria, performance levels, descriptions, and adopted a scoring scheme:

Performance Levels, Descriptions, and Scoring: 
{{step_5}}

Next, provide an explanation of how to use the rubric, including how scores are totaled and how feedback will be delivered. Make sure the explanation is aligned with the needs of a "Teaching Assistant".

->>>>

We have details on scoring and instructions on how to use this rubric:

Scoring and Usage Instructions: 
{{step_6}}

Now, incorporate a section emphasizing the importance of academic integrity and ethical conduct, especially relevant to the grading process for {{course_name}}.

->>>>

We have scoring instructions for our rubric and a section on academic integrity:

Scoring and Usage Instructions: 
{{step_6}}

Academic Integrity and Ethics Section:
{{step_7}}

Also, allocate a section for overall comments and feedback, to give the "Teaching Assistant" a space to provide personalized insights to improve the student's future performance in {{course_name}}.

->>>>

We now added a section for overall feedback to our rubric:

Academic Integrity and Ethics Section:
{{step_7}}

Feedback Section:
{{step_8}}

Finally, summarize how the rubric aligns with the overall educational goals of the course or program: {{course_name}}. This will highlight the rubric's relevance to not just grading but also learning progress.
