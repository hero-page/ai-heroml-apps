Here is your task to write a "Service Level Agreement" for the "IT Infrastructure Documentation" industry, specifically for an "IT Manager". 
Let's start by crafting an introduction that briefly discusses the purpose and objectives of the Service Level Agreement, specifically indicating the services offered by the IT team: {{IT_services}}.

Here's some more context about the Service Level Agreement:
IT Services: {{IT_services}}
IT Services Scope: {{IT_services_scope}}
Performance Metrics: {{performance_metrics}}
Roles And Responsibilities: {{roles_and_responsibilities}}
Expected Outcomes: {{expected_outcomes}}
Industry Standards: {{industry_standards}}
Penalties: {{penalties}}

->>>>

For our Service Level Agreement, we have an introduction:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next task is to define the scope of IT services, specifying the nature and extent of these services: {{IT_services_scope}}.

->>>>

Along with the introduction, we have now established the scope of IT services:

Scope of Services:
{{step_2}}

Our next step is to elaborate the service level objectives. Let's define specific metrics for gauging the performance of the IT services: {{performance_metrics}}. Include priority levels for every service in case of incidents and their respective response and resolution times.

->>>>

We have an introduction, a scope of services, and now, service level objectives for our Service Level Agreement:

Service Level Objectives:
{{step_3}}

Following this, incorporate a section outlining roles and responsibilities. Here, define each party's (the IT Department and the end-users) specific duties and tasks that ensure the effectiveness of the IT services: {{roles_and_responsibilities}}.

->>>>

Our Service Level Agreement now consists of an introduction, a scope of services, service level objectives, and definition of roles and responsibilities:

Roles and Responsibilities:
{{step_4}}

The following task concerns service management. Detail how the IT services will be managed, supervised, and reviewed. Explain how service requests, incidents, changes and service continuity will be handled.

->>>>

We have service management details along with the introduction, scope of services, service level objectives, and roles and responsibilities in our Service Level Agreement:

Service Management:
{{step_5}}

Subsequently, state the expected outcomes, benefits or results that will be accomplished by the delivery of the IT services: {{expected_outcomes}}.

->>>>

For our Service Level Agreement, we have expected outcomes added to the previously mentioned sections:

Expected Outcomes:
{{step_6}}

The penultimate step is to talk about related industry standards, regulations or compliances that the IT services are required to follow: {{industry_standards}}.

->>>>

We've added industry standards to our Service Level Agreement:

Industry Standards:
{{step_7}}

Now, draft a section on penalties, indicating any associated fines or warnings that will be imposed if the IT services fail to meet the specified service levels: {{penalties}}.

->>>>

With the section on penalties, our Service Level Agreement looks like this:

Penalties:
{{step_8}}

To conclude, let's formulate a summary that revisits the objectives of the Service Level Agreement, emphasizing the cooperative efforts between the IT services provider and end-users to ensure service efficiency.

->>>>

We are near the end, having the conclusion added to our Service Level Agreement:

Conclusion:
{{step_9}}

Finally, consider appending an 'Appendices' section. This should contain any additional information, definitions, protocols, or guidelines that will support the administration of the IT services.
