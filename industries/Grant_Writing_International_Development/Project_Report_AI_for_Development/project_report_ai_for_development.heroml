Your task is to write a "Beneficiary Report" for the "Grant Writing - International Development" industry, specifically for a "Project Coordinator". 

First, provide an overview that gives the context of the project: {{project_context}}, and a brief summary of its objectives.

Here's some more context about the Beneficiary Report:
Project Context: {{project_context}}
