Let's draft an "Email to Guests" for a "Hotel Manager" in the "Hospitality & Tourism" industry. 

First, we'll construct an opening greeting. This needs to be warm, friendly, and aimed at welcoming the guests and thanking them for their hotel booking. An example is "Dear [Guest's Name], We are delighted to welcome you to [Hotel Name]".

Here's some more context about the Email to Guests:
