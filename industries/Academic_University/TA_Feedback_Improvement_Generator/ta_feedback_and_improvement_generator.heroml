Here is your task to create a "Student Feedback" for a "Teaching Assistant" in the "Academic & University" industry. 
Let's start by writing an introduction that states the purpose of the feedback and provides context for your relationship with the {{teaching_assistant}}.

Here's some more context about the Student Feedback:
Teaching Assistant: {{teaching_assistant}}
Specific Instance 1: {{specific_instance_1}}
Specific Instance 2: {{specific_instance_2}}

->>>>

Now, you have the introduction for your "Student Feedback":

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Next, write an overall assessment of the {{teaching_assistant}}, including highlighting their strengths.

->>>>

With the introduction and overall assessment complete, this is your feedback so far:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Overall Assessment:
{{step_2}}

Moving forward, provide specific experiences from your classroom with the {{teaching_assistant}}. Mention their helpfulness, clarity in explanations, availability for discussions, responsiveness, and interaction.

Now you have an introduction, an overall assessment, and a detailed account of your experiences. Here is your current feedback:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Overall Assessment:
{{step_2}}

Specific Experiences:
{{step_3}}

For the next step, detail how the {{teaching_assistant}} has helped in enhancing your understanding of the academic subject matter.

Now, this is your feedback: 

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Overall Assessment:
{{step_2}}

Specific Experiences:
{{step_3}}

Teaching Capability:

Now, let's give constructive criticism. Remember, not all feedback is positive; however, it should be constructive and assist the {{teaching_assistant}} in understanding the areas of improvement.

->>>>

We have the feedback's Introduction, Overall Assessment, Specific Experiences, Teaching Capability, and now a section on constructive criticism:

Introduction:
{{step_1}}

Overall Assessment:
{{step_2}}

Specific Experiences:
{{step_3}}

Teaching Capability:
{{step_4}}

Constructive Criticism:
{{step_5}}

Moving on, suggest actions which the {{teaching_assistant}} might consider to improve future learning experiences.

Now you have added recommendations to your feedback:

Introduction:

Overall Assessment:
{{step_2}}

Specific Experiences:
{{step_3}}

Teaching Capability:
{{step_4}}

Constructive Criticism:
{{step_5}}

Recommendations:
{{step_6}}

To conclude the feedback, let's sign off politely. Write a closing statement that includes a final expression of appreciation for the TA's efforts.
