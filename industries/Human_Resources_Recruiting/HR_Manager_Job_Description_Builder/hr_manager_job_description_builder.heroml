Your task is to write a "Job Description" for the "Human Resources & Recruiting" industry, specifically for a "HR Manager". We will break down the steps to accomplish this.

Let's start by generating a concise, clear job title. E.g. Human Resources Manager.

Here's some more context about the Job Description:
Company Overview: {{company_overview}}
Role Overview: {{role_overview}}
Key Responsibilities: {{key_responsibilities}}
Required Qualifications: {{required_qualifications}}
Experience Required: {{experience_required}}
Job Benefits: {{job_benefits}}

The job title has been generated:

Job Title:
{{step_1}}

Next, we need to write a compelling job summary. The summary should provide an overview of {{company_overview}} and define the role of the HR Manager within the organization {{role_overview}}.

Moving on, we need to list the key responsibilities of the HR Manager. This list should include the major duties, key tasks, goals, and responsibilities that fall under {{key_responsibilities}}. The key responsibilities should clarify the scope of work for the HR Manager in the specific organization.
